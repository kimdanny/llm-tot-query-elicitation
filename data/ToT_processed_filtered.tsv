304	A movie I saw on tv a while ago about a few girls, maybe siblings or siblings and friends, who perform a witchy ritual in the woods (i thinkk they were naked) and 1 or maybe 2 girls fell into a coma. i remember that she was in her bed in an attic room as well. I dont remember if it was american or british but it was in english. it was a fairly recent movie, i think maybe 2000s but not before 1995 at least. please help i really want to watch this movie !	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible_(1996_film)	The Crucible (1996 film)
831	I had read in a movie review that the movie Run Lola Run was similar to the idea explored in another (possibly French) movie that showed 16 different storylines based on a decision to light a cigarette.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking/No_Smoking	No Smoking
558	At some point the the 90’s I saw a film on tv (probably HBO) that was set in the 1700’s. I don’t remember much, but I was just thinking about it and it’s bothering me not knowing now. I remember there was a decent amount of sex/sexual references. It’s not your typical pride and prejudiced, sense and sensibility type period piece. I’m pretty sure there were quite a few well known actors in it as well, I just can’t seem to remember any of them. There was a point in the film where there was some sort of scheme for this one man to sleep with a young girl and take her virginity. That’s all I really remember. Any ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Liaisons	Dangerous Liaisons
1013	so there is this movie based off the 1950s t0 60s(in color) it is during a war or a nuclear bomb time . its not to dramatic even thoe it during a warish time because its a comedy. there are these parents I think the mom is blonde they have a son. they protect him in an underground bombshelter that is just like the real world .one day he finally sees the present world (which looks like 1990-2012). key clues he meets a homeless guy that says he is jesus, a black women he calls a  negro, he has a love interest , he has this special cream from the 50s or 60s, at the end of the movie he buys his parents a house (I think he can afford it bcuz he found a way to make the ointment he had ) tnx guyz if you read this I really enjoy movies when I watch them they really make me feel like life doesn’t suck so your help is appreciated( I think I saw it on showtime or hbo in 2013 9r 14 but I don’t think it came out that late)  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_from_the_Past_(film)	Blast from the Past (film)
990	I am looking for a 1940s-1950s black and white movie that I have seen on TV a long time ago (15-20 years ago). I think it was a dark comedy, with an opening scene featuring two women hitchhicking; one of them lifts her skirts and makes a car crash. They reach a mansion (which was about to be inherited by one of them), and spend the night. One of the women gets killed (the one inheriting the mansion was supposed to get killed, but because they changed rooms, the other one gets murdered). The ghost of the dead woman remains to haunt the house. A clumsy detective appears to solve the crime but gets himself in a set of ridiculous situations (at some point there is a scene in which he gets trapped in a refrigerator); in the attempt to solve the mistery, they discover secret passageways and chambers of the mansion (one of them leads to a river used to transport dead bodies). That’s all the information I have (and I am not entirely certain of their accuracy – it’s been a long time since I’ve seen the movie). Any suggestions are much appreciated. Cheers!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topper_Returns	Topper Returns
228	I saw this presidential spoof movie on TCM about 6 years ago, most likely originally from the 70s. It was in color. I remember two scenes. In one scene the protagonist is on a house boat I think it was yellow. I believe he may have been choosing clothes at some point. I remember him talking to someone as he walked throughout the boat. In another scene I think he tries to reach out to hippies. He tries drugs and makes love in the grass with one maybe two women. I saw this on TV so nothing explicit, but I remember the humor being very dry and adult.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_President%27s_Analyst#In_popular_culture	The President%27s Analyst#In popular culture
978	I can’t remember what the overall theme was but there was a scene in it where a man and woman were in the backseat of a car making out etc. The view switched back and forth from what they were doing to a cartoon of what was happening inside the man’s body, like, little guys pulling levers. Anyone remember what the movie was?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Sex*_(*But_Were_Afraid_to_Ask)_(film)	Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)
972	1960s British comedy similar in style to “The Gods Must Be Crazy”. An English couple head overseas on safari. The woman is the sensible one whereas the man is the naive, silly one. He gets his jeep stuck on a muddy bush track (the film is sped up as he rushes about trying to extract himself from his predicament). The film is slightly notable for the fact that I recognize some of the tunes played throughout the movie. Any ideas anyone?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_Must_Be_Crazy	The Gods Must Be Crazy
551	The film begins with rednecks in a truck towing another redneck on a board down a slope. The towed man crashed into a barbed wire fence. A city-dweller with his wife on holiday is harassed by them. He defeats the ring leader with a karate blow.  I forget the rest.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shuttered_Room	The Shuttered Room
743	I saw this approximately 2010-2012. Main character in a office building when aliens made of light attack. Style of the short series was 1960’s retro black in white but done in 2000’s. A NASA Orion era astronaut comes to the rescue, sent by I think a moon base? (not sure on that) who he has intermittent contact with. NASA astronaut comes with his gun full of bullets, apparently made of light only thing able to kill the light aliens. They have a adventure and at the end they disarm some bomb in a parking garage. Eventually they split paths. NASA is shown on Mercury? in conflict with someone else. While the man in the office gets a package with a bunch of the light bullets. This was in English. On a ComCast on Demand channel, somewhere in some independent? sci-fi channel.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mercury_Men	The Mercury Men
1068	I was a kid when I saw this on TV in the 70s so my memory of it is sketchy.  It scared the crap out of me.  It had something to do with the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.  There are people on a boat where one by one they die after they rescue someone from the ocean.  I think that rescued person is a evil entity that ends up taking over the body of each dead person like a meat suit to continue killing people.  There’s a scene where a dead person seems to be levitating in the air, but as the camera pans, you can see that the body is actually speared by a swordfish that is mounted on the wall of the boat.  Some how they are able to call the Coast Guard and get rescued.  Except the bad person (who made it onto the helicopter) managed to cause the chopper to go down killing everyone.  You see the dead bodies floating in the water … camera zooms to one of the dead Guardsman with his face in the water.  But then he lifts his head and gives a evil grin showing he’s alive.  So basically the evil that has been haunting the Bermuda Triangle continues on in the one entity that moves from one dead body to another.  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan's_Triangle	Satan's Triangle
164	I think that the movie was about a teenager/young adult somehow ending up in another dimension trying to save his girlfriend or something like that. There’s a bald (and scarred?) cop in sunglasses that apprehends the teenager at some point and cuffs him with handcuffs that consists of two hands chained to each other. I might making this one up, but I think that the cops sunglasses breaks towards the end and that it kills him. If so, sorry for the spoiler.. ? In another scene towards the end a succubus tries to trick the teenager into having sex with her, but the teenager notices the succubus’s tail. The world/dimension is some kind of post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. I reckon this movie might be from the late 80’s or early 90’s and it’s an American movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_to_Hell_(film)	Highway to Hell (film)
425	I just re,ember this one specific scene in a 1980’s action movie that starred a actor who does action moves (can’t remember who it was).   The scene has these bad guys chasing them in a small town.  They break into a gun store or military surplus store and steal guns and stuff.  One of the guy get a LAW (light anti-tank weapon) and shots it into one of the businesses on the street.  He then yells “I LIKE IT!!!”  Then they take off to do more damage.  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop	RoboCop
629	the approximate date you saw it, – I dont recall mid to late 80’s whether it was in English or another language – English whether you saw it on TV (it might be a TV episode rather than a movie) – I remember seeing it on KTLA movie night (channel 5 in L.A. area). whether it was in color or black and white – Color anything else you can think of that might help pinpoint the film. – unknown  I dont remember the  whole movie only parts. Things that could be Key would be the house/setting was a desert home i believe in Arizona. I remember seeing some kind of pyramid shaped portal or door close to or even in the bayrad of the house. another thing i recall seeing in the movie was small ufo’s flying through the house.  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_Time_Ended	The Day Time Ended
894	The movie is something I saw sometime 1996-1997 on cable tv. The movie is about a teenage girl who paints or studies fine arts and lives by herself. She is a bit sexual. She then begins to have an affair with her older and married arts/painting instructor/teacher which sees her and paints her in the nude afterwhich they have sex… It was surely an english movie and colored. There were also scenes like an asian boardmate that played the cello and a scene where the girl and the teacher make out or something in the kitchen while the teacher hosts a friendly dinner at his house for the girl.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_II:_Lily	Poison Ivy II: Lily
379	Seems like this might have been an afterdark horrorfest or similar… main scene I remember is a woman waking up hanging in a barn, her friend is hanging next to her, the “farmer” comes in a sharpens a knife and places a mask over the friends head and a bucket underneath I think he ends up killing the friend… later the woman gets away, but it turns out because the monster wasnt fed it comes out of the cellar and starts killing everyone… sorry I cant remember more… posted once before but went unanswered plz help me figure this one out… THANX	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rites_of_Spring_(film)	Rites of Spring (film)
553	The movie was in the 90’s maybe late 80’s. There were two kids swinging at their home while their mom was inside. A man pulled up. I think he may have been driving a station wagon. He took the two children. One of the kids mittens fell off and stayed stuck in the swing. The mother looked out and noticed them missing. When she went out all that was there was a glove/mitten in the chain of the swing. I am thinking the man that took them was bald on top but had gray hair on the sides with a full gray beard. I have been looking for title to this movie for yeara. Please help it is driving me nuts!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Are_the_Children%3F	Where Are the Children%3F
498	I remember this movie from when I was younger.   I’ve no idea on the release or when exactly I watched it but it had to of been in the mid to late 80’s. Starts off with the inhabitants of a village all frantic to pack and flee as quickly as they can.   Every so many years this cult would return and bring evil with them. A young girls falls asleep or gets lost while playing with her friends in some tower or water mill type structure.  Her father stays behind searching for her. Two male backpackers traveling across the region wander into the village as the people are fleeing.  They disbelieve the legends told to them or could have not understood the meanings. The cult arrives after the dark falls and begins capturing villagers and hunting down anyone in the area.  Victims caught were hung on a cross and placed before a creature.  It would open its two arms wider revealing a third arm with three fingers extending from its chest.  When placed on the chest of the victim it would burn/brand them leaving a three fingered mark.  They would then become devoted followers. The father ends up being captured later on and he is branded. The two hikers are running down a stone staircase from some cultists when one of them falls.  With an injured leg he can no longer run so his friend pulls him aside and keeps running to lure away the cultists. I’ve no idea who stars in it,   was before my mind payed attention to those parts of the movie.  I’m sure there is more that happens but this bit is what my mind remembers the most.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_Day_(1988_film)	Judgement Day (1988 film)
555	I saw this clip on dailymotion. It seems to have been deleted now as I can’t find it. It was a color video. There is a half nude Arabian girl dancing around 5 men sitting on the floor, 3 of whom are playing instruments. There are two guest girls too who are also sitting and watching the dance. One of the girl hints the other girl about the dance. The other girl then stands up and starts stripping while dancing and gets full nude. The men also stand up and start clapping to encourage. The first guest girl also joins and starts stripping and dancing and gets full nude. Towards the end of the clip the music dies and the men form a canopy with their long robes and cover all the three girls. Can anyone help to identify the name of the movie?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuelle_in_Bangkok	Emanuelle in Bangkok
1089	Caught on late afternoon tv in Greater New York/tri-state area in late ’60’s or very early ’70’s. All I remember is a dark scaly monster, the size of a large human, walking down a day-lit street with a bloody human head in its claw, palming it like a basketball. I was less than 12 years old; haven’t seen it since. Can’t speak to colors; only had black & white tv! Not much to go on, I know, but if anyone can help, please do!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_of_Piedras_Blancas	The Monster of Piedras Blancas
969	i remember it being a postapocalypic type movie where hero fights a monster inside a thunderdome type arena. He fights a 5 headed beast, (snake I think) which is controlled by the boss. The boss dips his hand in a bowl with yellow liquid and controls the monster with his fingers, whenever the hero cuts a monster’s head he loses a finger	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Highness	Your Highness
937	Here is one I saw long ago >> 20 years on TV, probably a “Creature Double Feature”.  Hippy dirtbag guy finds this alien weapon.  He puts his arm into it and has a good time blasting stuff with the laser pulse.  It may have impregnated his palm with some sort of thing (maybe a gem or a scab).  Eventually he loses his humanity to the weapon and he becomes an alien (after he finds that he can no longer remove his arm).  I remember him blasting stuff like telephone poles maybe.  Gun looked like a tube that you stuck your forearm into…poor bastard.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laserblast	Laserblast
466	Ok, so I think this was a mid to late 60’s detective caper. I’m picturing a rumpled B movie gumshoe ala Peter Falk or Alan Arkin (but not them), solving this case of disappearing models/actresses. It’s sketchy, but I remember one of the girls was strangled with a snake that was hidden in a fur coat. I remember the final scene in this space age looking lab with giant cryogenic capsules that were holding the starlets for the evil scientist’s future “use” The movie had a strong technicolor aspect- that’s pretty much all I got.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_the_Girls_and_Make_Them_Die	Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die
495	Movie series spanned across 6 VHS tapes that I would rent at a Video Connection while growing up. In color, in English, rented films, don’t remember if ever on TV, had to have been released very late 80s but possibly up to mid 90s, I believe I would have watched between 1995-98. I remember the 2nd film having like a large alien race with bald/possibly Conehead resemblances that captured the main protagonist. I can’t remember if he traveled via spaceship or what. But those large aliens in movie 2 put him in a large terrarium type of setting like what a tarantula would be in, but I don’t remember if there were any threats like spiders, snakes etc. Film 3 brought the protagonist to a town and I swear one of the characters in the third film was basically a real-life raggedy Anne doll or something. There were other helpers in this town; a convention or type of fall festival was ongoing while the guy visited in search of the crystal or whatever it was he was looking for. Can’t remember films 1, 4, or 6 for the life of me, but I remember that at the end of film 4 there was a preview for the 5th one that included their spaceship or perhaps a subway train or something being attacked by like brown worm like monsters which was going to stop or crash what the protagonist was riding in. I feel like at the beginning of the series he may have been in his room on a computer and brought aboard a spaceship to begin the adventure. He may be brown/darker haired and have a new partner or group of folks tagging along eacf film or a new partner coming on board for the remainder of the adventure. I’m thinking he wasn’t alone. I can’t remember completely but I believe the 2nd film had a yellow vhs box showing large hands reaching into the terrarium, and movie 3 may have been bright pink as the box with the raggtedy Anne character on the cover with the main character and a few others. The ultimate questbor goal was to reunite their crystal shards or collecting so many pieces of a shiny substance. I don’t think they traveled through time, though it is possible. I never got to watch or find out how the series ended because the video rental store never acquired a copy to my knowledge. Please help me as I’ve struggled remembering this from my childhood since I originally watched them back then. Thanks in advance!	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kirby…_Time_Warrior!

838	He meets this girl in a café basically, and he ends up going over to her place later. She has a roomate that is doing paper mache stuff. Rest may or may not be in order: There´s this gag throughout the movie about two guys in a van stealing stuff, among those the paper mache thing, and the main character calls them out for it but we learn those were friends of the roommate. I´m fairly sure the girl(might´ve been the roomate) dies at some point or in the midst of the movie. There´s a note that one of them have gone to a “hard rock” bar or disco, and the main character goes there, and in the party, some guys pin him down and attempt/or succesfully shave his head.

350	Well, there’s not much I remember but this was kinda a B movie. I remember a deaf-mute girl and his mother living in a barrack in swamps – crocodiles, and boats. I remember this little deaf-mute girl, dressed with a white short shirt, barefoot, that was eventually chased and raped by two bad redneck-style guys. Was a very hard scene – she was raped with a gun and shoot with the same gun. The movie itself was about this life in the swamp and all this weird people. Can’t find anywhere anything about this movie. I saw it about in the late ’70 – maybe 1980-1985 but I think it was made in the ’70.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Gator_Bait	%27Gator Bait
1099	All I remember about this movie is the music video that I used to watch in the early 80s. The movie was either from the late 70s or the early 80s. It was a wild comedy. I’m not sure about the plot but  judging from the scenes in the music video, it was people in a town and they were affectd by either a drug or some sort of magic that made them go crazy. There was a rock band or a concert or sthg. The lyrics were something like “it’s a crazy world” In the video there are a lot of people doing crazy stuff, and ther is a guy kicking a (fake) dog over a balcony.  It ends in a crescendo and the music is very cheerful	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Crazy	Get Crazy
567	Hi, new to this site, but a memory of a movie I saw in ~1986-1988 when I was 3 or four years is still bugging me.  My only recollection of this movie that it was a high fantasy, sword & sorcery type movie that was on network television (I didn’t have cable) during daylight hours.  All I remember is a man in a dark red cavern with a sword talking to what looked like a very large dragon or monster which made either a deep booming sound or actually talked to him.  The monster appeared to be several stories tall, and the scene took place toward the very end of the movie, because i remember it ended soon after.  I believe it was the climax of the movie.  I know it is not the movie “Legend”, but it may be similar to that. Thanks for your help, this has been bothering me for 25+ years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonslayer_(1981_film)	Dragonslayer (1981 film)

230	I remember a horror movie from the early 70s (I think). I saw it on TV but it was definitely a movie – not a TV movie. It was in color. Story was (3) girls win a contest to go on vacation in a nice chalet. The girls get there and a nice couple pamper, spoil them and feed them. After the first night one of the girls goes missing and the family tells the remaining girls that the girl just went home but it becomes apparent later that the family are cannibals and are eating the girls. I remember one of the girls was black and I think she got eaten first. Only one girls survives. And I think the girls may have been college students. Not sure if it was American or foreign but it had that 70’s Italian Horror vibe to it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_at_Red_Wolf_Inn	Terror at Red Wolf Inn
565	Judging by the quality, I’d say this film was made in the 70s. It’s about a large American family who all come back home to attend the funeral of the youngest member, a guy who killed himself. After the funeral, which happens early in the film, they all go home, and from there it’s basically one of those films where everyone’s thinking about their life choices, etc. There’s a bit of tension because they’ve all got their own lives and live in different states so they don’t see each other a lot.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Chill_(film)	The Big Chill (film)

437	I watched this movie in 1982 or earlier as a kid. It may have been a 70s movie. It was a movie in English, in colour. This is what I remember: There was a young guy, driving a (doubledecker?) bus or some sort of caravan. He may have been in a foreign country, in the countryside. He meets a pretty girl and wanted to ask her directions (I think). She doesn’t speak English, and she thought that the guy wants to marry her. So she happily brings him back to her village and introduces him to her father. They are gypsies or something like that. I don’t know if it’s a musical but I know there’s some singing in the movie.

344	I was born in 1982 and remember from some point from 83-87 this Japanese anime movie with animals (reminds me of Pokemon characters), a young girl who go out on adventure to save…something or someone. One vivid memory is a woman who “is” the sky, as in when, it is night, she turns day into night by sweeping across the sky with her dress or a cape and that is the “night.” Makes me think of Gaia in Greek Mythology. The animal characters do a lot of jumping from rock to rock and have wide, expressions and mouths. Does this ring a bell??	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unico#Anime	Unico#Anime
759	70’s sci-fi colour movie – member of group cuts off arm of another member to save his life because of blade tip is moving up his arm. Hi guys, I hope you can help me with this movie as it’s been stuck in my head for the last 30+ years. This is what I can remember; This is a sci-fi, I can’t remember where it is set or even if it’s on Earth, but there’s a group of people, maybe 6 or so. One of them is tough and has some sort of blades/knives as weapons. He can throw these and they come back to him – similar to a boomerang. One of the other members is a bit of a wimp (from memory). The wimpy guy takes/borrows one of these knives and I think he must throw it or something, anyway something happens and the tip of the knife sticks into his forearm. When the tough guy tries to pull the knife out, the tip breaks off and starts to travel up the wimpy guys arm. He decides to cut his arm off to save his life. That’s all I can remember. Except I think in another scene the knives are used to try and open a doorway to a cave or something. Any help would be appreciated Cheers, DrCarl.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_of_Terror	Galaxy of Terror
354	I remember seeing a movie on TV (in the US, in English, in color) in the 70s or possibly early 80s. iirc it took place on Earth and there was an invasion of creatures that looked like flat, stingray-like things that moved slowly across the ground without any visible legs (kind of like flattened slugs). Each creature  had a single vertical stalk/appendage that it used to “look” around. The creatures didn’t have any eyes or discernible features and they were very alien looking. I don’t remember much else about it but it made an impression on me as a kid. I’m not sure if it was made for TV. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Terror	Island of Terror

Some crazy things happen which I can’t really remember, but at the end of the movie the parents have become clouds of spores or something, it’s revealed that the son can go outside safely and the parents give his girlfriend the ability to go outside as well.

The film was about a group of college kids who go out to this island to stay with a friend. One by one they all start dying…well, she said she thinks they’re all murdered, but she remembers one of them falling off a boat and getting killed by the propellers. She also remembers one of them being found dead in a well and she said it was a scary scene because someone goes down in the well to get the body and almost gets stuck. She doesn’t remember the ending very well, but said she thinks one of the friends is orchestrating all the killings.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fool%27s_Day_(1986_film)	April Fool%27s Day (1986 film)

The teens in the movie decide to host a horror movie fest in a theater.  The number one thing I remember about this movie is there was smell-o-vidion while they were watching the movies and I believe it may have been 3d as well.

Years later boy comes back to seaside town as man and starts seeing the young girl now as mysterious woman that seems to come out of ocean and is friend to giant sea turtle. His buddy is the captain of a fishing boat (played by ex-football player?) and at end is dragged to bottom by the turtle. Its right at the front of my brain but I can’t Google the sucker…plus I’m liking the process of seeing who’s got more movie knowledge rolling around their skull. So…help me put my mind right and halp me out.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bermuda_Depths	The Bermuda Depths
769	We watched this movie on christmas day and it was narrated by the boy who had become a man and was reminiscing.  It told of all the efforts he went to to get this bb gun for christmas	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Story	A Christmas Story
662	I watched this when I was under 10 yrs old and it was in the 80’s and in English. All I can remember is one scene. This group of 5 or 6 girls (high school or college age) convince this overweight girl to change into a bikini or skimpy outfit. They tell her to wait in a room. Next thing that happens is a guy that I think the girl likes, walks into the room and she’s mortified and he’s mad and feels bad for her. All the girls start laughing and the girl runs out of the room. Also, this scene was in the daytime. I remember it being very bright in the room from sunlight. I know it’s not much to go on, but I hope someone knows what this is from. It’s been driving me crazy trying to figure it out. Thanks	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_to_Heaven	Highway to Heaven
561	I believe it was somewhere mid-80’s to mid 90’s but not 100% sure. I do know I saw it in the 90’s as a kid. The scene I remember is a girl is sitting on a guy’s lap at some concert or party. They’re making out and she leans back. He sort of dips her and while she is upside down she sees the alien on the ground. I’m not sure if the alien kills her or what but when the guys pulls her back up she seems passed out so he just lets her drop to the ground and walks off to party elsewhere. I also believe there was a scene where a homeless man sleeping in the sewer was attacked by the alien but I could be mixing movies. Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hidden_II	The Hidden II
804	It is a horror movie where the female main protagonist is trying to wake up from a nightmare but everytime she wakes up shes still in a dream. The end scene is showing two guys looking like Ted Boys from the 50 going upstairs in a basement, while one is havine a hole where his ear should be. he snips at the hole and the ear appears.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Demon	Dream Demon
485	I don’t remember much more of this movie, but I always try to. I believe that they were aliens or monsters, the best way I could describe most of them is that they kind of looked like how the Power Rangers look when they have their suits on? And they seemed to be just fighting to the death in this warehouse or factory. I honestly wish I could remember more because I want to see this movie again so badly! I do remember them basically either being a side of good guys vs. bad guys, or them all fighting to the death.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guyver	The Guyver
217	I remember a scene from a movie, but it has been years and I fear my memory may be playing tricks on me because I can’t seem to find this movie. What I remember is 80s or 90s style sci-fi. Not scary, a bit weird. There is group of kids/teens with people from the other world. One was dwarf-like. I recall towards the end of the movie, they are in an electronics store and there is a battle, maybe some lightning. They have a gold cylinder, about 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter that when activated has spinning multi-color lights and plays a melody I can’t get out of my mind. I think it may be for traveling. That’s all I can remember, not much, but would love some help figuring this out if you have any ideas.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe	Masters of the Universe
696	I saw the last third of this movie late night in the late 90’s. I think on scifi channel. It was in English. In the scene I remember the mother and son in the house. Outside looked normal but the inside of the house morphed into a humid, moss coated jungle of cubby holes. The mother was telling the son something about staying there as her change was coming.(she too was in process of some type of change) He wanted her to leave with him as people outside wanted to harm them. I really want to figure this out. Please help…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(film)	Habitat (film)
132	OK…here’s another one… 80’s slasher movie set at maybe a carnival, fair or some other end of school festival in a dark wooded park area with a pavilion or decorated tent. Not much else I remember except for towards the beginning there’s a party with a live band that looks like a bunch of undead gangsters that plays that 80’s retro rockabilly and had a stupid name like the Corpse Devilles (don’t hold me to that). Note: ‘The Funhouse'(1980) seems like a good possibility but not totally…and…band could be John Carpenter’s Coupe Devilles but they never did the costume thing.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation_Day_(film)	Graduation Day (film)
781	I saw it on TV during the late 70’s or early 80’s. It was in English, and in color. I think it was a made for TV movie that consisted of a couple separate stories. I don’t remember the actors or much about the plot. In one of the stories, I think three deaths were predicted, and the prediction included the phrase, “one by land, two by sea, three by air.” Then, a man died in a skydiving accident. I think one of the other stories involved a bottomless pit in somebody’s back yard. A couple guys went down into it, and it was a doorway to hell. Thanks for your help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounter_with_the_Unknown	Encounter with the Unknown
170	Back sometime in the 80’s (mid-80’s?), I remember seeing a made-for-tv movie with a title something like Wish Boy or Wish Child.  As far as I can remember, it was about an alien or some kind of genetically different child. I don’t remember any of the actors.  The only scenes I remember about it were a scene near the beginning when a man (who is friends with the wish boy or maybe the guy who found him?) is driving with a woman, and the woman gets freaked out for a moment when she realizes there’s this little weird dude in the car with them.  Then the man reassures her that he’s friendly. The other scene I remember was from maybe the climax of the movie.  The little wish boy is standing in a warehouse or something, waiting for the bad guys to approach.  He’s holding two wires behind his back, and at the right moment, he touches them and makes a big explosion. I’ve been wondering about this for decades.  Thanks.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishman	Wishman
887	There is a horror movie (color, 90s/2000s, English) about a group of movie actors who go to a rural setting (possibly Scotland/Ireland) to film a movie. There is an old woman and a strange man who run the place they are staying in. There is some sort of lore the old woman speaks of. The heroine ends up at the end of the film discovering a series of tunnels/caves where a pregnant woman is chained. There are psychodelic sequences scattered throughout the film in times of stress…I think including when the heroine is killing or trying to kill the captor/murderer.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Breed:_The_Legend_of_Samhain	Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain
807	This was a movie definitely made in the 90s.  About a guy that left his little town when he was in high school because he beat up a football player who had hit his kid brother.  He used his karate skills and broke the guys nose.  Years later he comes back to town to find that it has been taken over by a bunch of kungfu masters.  He fights this really fat Asian guy at the end of the movie who is kicking his butt until he starts kicking the guy in his knees.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Weapon_(1991_film)	The Perfect Weapon (1991 film)
352	I saw a part of a movie around the early 90s ( was definitely filmed around then as well or maybe even late 80s and was in english ). I vaguely remember a girl with short hair eating part of something in class that was being dissected to gross out a blonde snobby girl who vomited upon seeing this. Any help solving this would be much appreciated. Thanks ahead of time!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_High_School_Forever	Rock %27n%27 Roll High School Forever
1015	Ok so all i can remember from this movie is… Its like a group or a family who end up at this strange haunted raggedy looking house an I remember it had alot of cars parked in the front and the family that lives there are a bunch of weirdos. There is one baled old man who walks with a cane and i believe they run an inn or have rooms that the group of people rent. The family looks like a bunch of hillbillies and they taunt the people that rent a room. I believe it is a twisted comedy I know this isnt much help but i just cant remember anything specifically. ALSO it has a well know actor in it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_but_Trouble_(1991_film)	Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)
310	Hey there! This has been driving me crazy for some time and my family and friends are starting to think I’m crazy. Im trying to figure out the name of a movie I saw in the mid to late 90s. I remember a young boy being waken up by an elaborate chain reaction alarm clock that went all around his room. He lived in a big 2 story house. He also had a small animated side kick friend thing. Everything/everyone else was real. It was not a fully animated film The only other thing I remember is that at some point he was on a game show of sorts and he either lost or got duped and ended up getting some sort of brown slime dumped on him as he came down a slide	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGee_and_Me!

134	This has eluded me and my brother for years. All we can remember is that it was a kid/young teen movie/tv movie about kids that discover a lizard monster in a swamp/forest. There’s a scene where they skate over an alligator. They also sit on a water tower and drink grape soda I believe. I know it’s a long shot. That’s literally all we can remember. Please help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Gator_Face	The Legend of Gator Face
956	I think this movie came out in the 90s. It is in English and color. It had something to do with a childhood friend of this guy gets invited to his party. The guy is really awkward and doesn’t fit in with the in-crowd. He is always ordering rum and cokes. His friend that invites him is successful and engaged I think. Towards the end of the movie the two guys end up having sex I think.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_&_Buck	Chuck & Buck
315	Ok so what I remember about this movie is that it may have been a TV movie and set in the 90’s. Is was about a pregnant woman who encountered her unborn child’s soul or something. But it had two souls one was evil and the other was light. Like an angel and devil. I can’t think of much else help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_Toys	Demonic Toys
232	In the late nineties/early 2000s my mom was watching a movie on tv. It was definitely aimed towards an adult audience but all I can remember from the film is this boy thinking of different ways to get his mothers attention, in one scene he’s in the pool pretending to have drowned and in another all I can remember is that he’s in a white room with blood everywhere and I think I remember he’s holding his decapitated head but I could be remembering that exact part incorrectly. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me find this movie I’ve been trying for going on ten years now!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_and_Maude	Harold and Maude
532	I saw this movie back in the 90s on tv.  The movie involved the government collecting kids from all over the world and bringing them to a center where they would train and test them to try to exploit their powers. It centered around two kids in particular. A boy who could control minds and a girl who could heal. The main character is a buy who is investing this government facility and in the end is trying to help shut it down. Specially he helps the girl escape. The two main scenes I remember is the girl that can heal finds a dead or wounded bird during recess at school with the investigator there and then after she holds it he notices later that the bird was either alive again or able to fly again. The other scene I remember is the boy with mind control abilities that the government used and was sort of the villain takes over the investigating guy while he has the girl with him and stops on train tracks and locks them both in the truck to get hit by the train. Hopefully this rings a bell for someone!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_Survivor_(2000_film)	Sole Survivor (2000 film)
1053	Hello everyone. I remember this scene, a girl was chased by some toys (probably dolls, carts, etc) and things (like chairs, wardrobes, tables, I don’t know). I remember that, this girl went up the stairs and locked herself in a room. The lively things began to break the door, and she, frightened, threw herself out the window. That’s the only memory I have of that movie. It’s from the 2000s (or older), and it was color. I thank you very much if you helped me find the name of the film.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(1988_film)	Alice (1988 film)
631	When I was around 8 years old I used to watch a lot of anime and cartoons. And I recall a scene, I don’t know if it is a movie or an animation with episodes. I just recall this one scene: It is a futuristic place. But looks like a ruined society style, with dirty builds and some technology left. And there is this woman who needs to jump through this passageway to reach where she needs to get. And one day, she tries to jump through it, but fails, and a machine, built within the passageway grabs here with robotic arms and cuts her legs of. So she will never make the jump again.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Æon_Flux	Æon Flux
371	I don’t remember what era this movie came out. so I remember a group of girls are staying in a cabin in the woods and this one girl gets out of the shower and the window/or mirror is foggy so she wipes it and a yeti pulls her out of the window. I also think there was more than one of these yeti things.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abominable_(2006_film)	Abominable (2006 film)
732	Hi everyone. I’m trying to remember a move I saw like 10 years ago, maybe a little more or a little less. There was a bunch of people locked in a house. All the movie happens in that house. It was a modern house that had a somewhat dark blue lighting. It always had that blue tint I think. I think they need to kill each other if they wanted to exit or something like that. It was probably an indie film, it seemed to have a low budget. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_9	House of 9
643	A colour film I saw on TV in mid 90s. I vaguely remember only a couple of shots and maybe some plot. There are a lot of “maybe”. Probably a fantasy or horror film from the 80s-90s. I won’t be surprised if it’s some episode from a “tales from the crypt”-like series. A guy receives or finds a watch (clock) or some device with arrows on it that opens gates or portals or doors.  The arrows point to the side where that portal should open. It might be not the central item of the film. There might be a girl that he tries to save (what a surprise). Perhaps she was lost in that portal. There might be a museum present in one of the scenes (might be another film). Super vague, yes, I know. But it stuck in my memory and I still didn’t manage to find that film. Thanks.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Runestone	The Runestone
380	I find this immensely frustrating because I can only give very vague descriptions. It was a comedy and I believe it was a movie (but it could have been a show, in which case I am very sorry). There is a group of friends and a couple of them accidentally join a cult.  The women are wearing old fashioned conservative type dresses (think FLDS type of dress). It takes place on this beautiful farm where there is a lot of tall overgrown grass and they are growing fruit and then later selling it on the side of the road. There is one point where they are all in a circular type cabin and they are passing around a “truth stick” or a gourd or something, where they can speak their mind but only if they are holding this stick/gourd. One of the guys gets super angry at the leader and breaks the stick/gourd because the leader kept purposefully keeping it away from him and being a dick about it. Finally a couple of the friends leave but leave one or two of the guys behind basically because the guy was getting laid a lot.  Then I remember something about how the fruit was super good and they ate it while selling some of it on the side of the road. If anyone knows what this is, PLEASE TELL ME!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych	Psych
1011	I remember this Action/Gun movie where they went to kill a woman but she was pregnant when they went in the room to kill her, It was time for her to have baby, so they didn’t kill her, I think it was a woman too and she delivered the baby at the house, there’s another scene where she was lying in bed with her boyfriend and she took a bubblegum out her mouth and put it on the lamp table and I think she said she can’t do this anymore, it’s like he’s a hitman/contract killer, that’s all I remembered.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowboxer	Shadowboxer
834	I remember a  movie this is what I can remember though: American movie, between 2007-20012 i watched it, It was in english coloured movie Action movie Father and Daughter Father finds out job is fake, He helps preventing deposit box robberies and they were just using him to break into a deposit box There is one scene he is in a car with a man and his daughter, he tells his daughter to fasten her seat belt and then crashes the car of a main road	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erased_(2012_film)	Erased (2012 film)
378	It was a movie I’ve only seen a short part of and I want to see all of it. Part of the plot included: a young guy gets often mocked in his neighborhood (i’m pretty sure the action took place in England). One day he sees a house explodes and a man walking away from that explosion. He decides to follow him around and finds out the man is a killer. He took some pictures of him and one day confronts him about wanting to become a killer too in order to kill his bullies. The man tries to kill him however he shows the photos he has taken and tells him that if he has copies and if he does not get home by 18:00 his parents will go to the police with the papers. The killer starts teaching the young boy how to kill so he goes for his first victim, the leader of the bullies. He goes to the bullie’s home, last floor in a very tall building. He sticks a bill on an antena, in the balcony and hides. When the bullie comes home, he notices the bill and tries to take it. The young boy comes out of hiding and pushes the bullie of the balcony. Once he gets down, the killer who trained him shows a picture of the boy pushing the bullie and tells him that he also has evidence against the boy, if he ever decides to go to the police.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_Man_(film)	Accident Man (film)
761	So this really good movie I cannot remember when I watched it but it was definitely after 2005, it was old but really good as in I would buy this on blu ray/dvd/anything just to own it, so here are the scenes I remember: The main character(woman) finally enters into the RV, I’m pretty sure or house, the kidnapper/killer has the girl in and she finds her, and she just looks beaten down, dirty and mute and when the main character tries to talk to her the little girl just doesn’t respond. But the woman says if you ever want me to help you or you just needs something….(and some other stuff I don’t remember) then just yell out Billy(I think) and so she tries to sneak the girl out of the RV but the guy finds them and they start fighting, I think the main character is a cop maybe. But anyways they start fighting and the kidnapper/killer guy seems to be wining… Second scene I remember, is the woman has to go and turn the little girl in an orphan, and as the woman is walking away the little girl start yelling out Billy(maybe) but I know while she’s walking away the little girl is being walked away by the orphanage staff or child protective services and she starts yelling out the name the woman gave her over and over again. So yeah, sorry these are the only scenes I remember and if this isn’t found out its okay because I understand since I gave some confusing unsure scenes.Thank You for any help and suggestions!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(film)	Intensity (film)
764	Watched it either in the end of 90’s or the beginning of 2000’s. It has the same structure as 10th Kingdom as it’s a series with not so many episodes. The plot goes: Wizards or sages from another world(medieval china iirc) summon a family(a girl and her dad) from our world(in a car) and a witch from a third party world to save their world from evil robots who turn out to be automative APC’s(multiwheeled armored vehicles armed with lasers). The Witch betrays them for her own goals. Robots use drills(someone hides underground in the tunnels/caves) and satelite like antenas to locate the heroes. At one point girl confronts a robot dressed in armor literally made of mirrors(to reflects lasers). She’s shot and knocked unconscious but is alive. Her dad storms a yard in a car(yellow jeep iirc) and the guards can’t stop him until he runs out of gas or the car malfunctions. The Witch uses a craft to travel via teleportation simillar to a small boat with two rows of seats facing each other and a spinning thing in the middle of it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbinder:_Land_of_the_Dragon_Lord	Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon Lord
1036	I saw it about 10 or 11 years ago on TV. The movie is about a hero who has a little damaged bat as his pet on his shoulder. The guy saved the bat when he was in some kind of prison (Shown in a flashback). As I mentioned in the “post title” it’s a medieval/fantasy type movie with mystical entities and other supernatural stuff. If I recall correctly, the story was about this guy saving a princess and going on a journey. I’ll be very thankful if you could name the movie. P.S. It’s not the Beastmaster.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfhound_(2006_film)	Wolfhound (2006 film)
746	I don’t recall how long ago it was that I saw this movie. If I were to guess, I would say 10 or more years ago but I could be wrong. Anyway, I remember this movie starting out with a father and his daughter leaving either a train station or maybe even an airport. He bumps into a couple of guys, or somehow gets into a small altercation with them. A couple of other people step in and claim to be cops and ask for the man and his daughter to come with them. They end up turning on him and his daughter, taking her hostage in order to blackmail him into completing a job for them. The couple were a man and a woman. The woman kept the daughter with her while the man took the father with him, I believe- started to instruct him on what he needed to do. The father had to get clever and began to enlist aid from a shoe shine guy and then later from a member of a political group. He was being asked to assassinate some politician but I don’t recall if it was a senator, mayor or what office the person held. The member of the political party got killed and the father discovered that the politician’s husband was in on the assassination plot. I do not remember all the details but I do know he didn’t go through with the plan and his daughter didn’t get killed. I do know I really enjoyed the movie but I can’t recall the title. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_of_Time_(film)	Nick of Time (film)

790	Colour, possibly made for TV in the 1970s or 80s. In English. The one scene I remember was when the cult leader, a small, skinny elderly but healthy guy with no hair and dark eyebrows, dressed in white, visits the cult chapter personally, and all the young people there are enthralled. There were black and white banners simply with his picture on all round the room. I think it centred around the family if a young person who had been drawn into the cult trying to get them out, and if I recall was done in an almost documentary 16mm style more akin to Canadian output than US. It’s not Split Image or Ticket To Heaven, which don’t have the same cult leader.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_by_the_Light_%28film%29	Blinded by the Light %28film%29

She was soon let out of the hospital, but once she got home she had to have what it seemed like vinegar and brown paper put on her legs. She got braces on her legs and tried to walk.

321	I have watched this movie on 2004 or something on Tv. There is this guy, a very good hit man. He falls in love with a girl. There was this scene which i exactly remember. He goes to a job and knocks door. Host opens the door and welcomes him. He chats with the host and his wife about his current relationship. Somehow host decides to ask why he is there. He suddenly take his gun out and kills them. He was there to kill them. Another scene that i remember. His gf’s ex create some disturbance for her. And then our guy arrives and tells his gf ” let me speak to him” He and her ex sits outside of the house. Gf watches from inside. She is not able to see their front face. Anyway our guy takes out the gun and hit to guy’s face or nose and warns him in a very cool way. Of course our girl was not able to see the violence which happened there.

611	During Halloween I seen a movie in color, English, NOT the cartoon monster house, it was not animated  the base of the movie was a living house that killed people and regenerated. Starting scene was of a small boy going to retrieve a toy that landed on  the other side of the fence, and well the house got him. Eventually a  group of investigators come, during there scoping out the house it locked them in and starts trying to kill them, one dies and gets sucked either into the wall or bed and the house starts to regenerate. Somehow they find out that a shed in the back of the house has an endless well that they need to destroy. During the rest of the movie with the bulk of people its dark and raining out. Trying to figure a way to get there their manager comes by and tries to get into the house the try to tell him not to come in so they lock him out. Some time skip and a guy dies by a tree coming to life and killing him. Eventually two people make it to the shed, can’t remember what they do but they eventually die. (I think) The manager is brainwashed by the house into killing some of the people and eventually the end is him refurbishing the house and renting the house that kills more people till eventually no one will rentbuy it. The ending scene is a paranormal tourist van passing by narrating the incidents and the manager running out saying go away.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bones	House of Bones
364	This one is a bit of a challenge as i only watched a couple scenes. I remember this man holding a young woman hostage. She’s handcuffed, her hands behind her back. She lies on a couch sleep, she’s gagged. She wakes up, he lets her speak. Then it’s more like pieces of scenes i remember. He feeds her pizza while they’re sitting on the couch, she has to pee, goes to the toilet (for some reason they actually show us the procedure…), she asks for discetion, he helps her and goes out the toilet leaving her there cuffed. After she’s done he enters to wipe her clean. The reason why i’m so explicit is that i don’ remember anything else. Also, i watched it no later than 2007 on tv. it didn’t seem too old at the time so i would say that it may not be an earlier than 1990’s film. Good luck ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Hit	The Big Hit
250	Thriller I rented 8 years ago. Set on coast of Monaco or Italy. Alfred-hitch like film. An American woman staying in a villa awaiting her husband who is stuck in the U.S. To join her, befriends an American soldier. She invites h to dinner at her villa (?) where he aggressively tries to rape her. She kills him and hides his body in a trunk…a policeman is onto her.., in color early 60’s. Can’t think of the name!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_to_Moment	Moment to Moment
825	Hi, its been years im looking for this movie. I saw it like in 2006 maybe, when i was 7. I saw it various times in tv (i think in iSat, or something like that), It looked like a 2000 movie, it wasnt too old. It looked like an action movie and has this blue or green cold color palet. What i remember is a woman that found a mirror in an alley or backstreet, she gets through that and enter to this world that look like a big big kinda abandoned city. I think she meets up with a men that wears a rabbit head, that knew that everyone was looking for her and that she was in danger, so he helped her. I remember an scene where they were like walking by a giant building like in the corner because there was a big void or something, it was huge and they were filmmed like from an up view In a part of the movie they both meet this weird pot druggy guy that has like a place with a lot of plants or something along that lines? This guy i think give them something. Then the next thing i remember is this girl and the rabbit man running from something, and they get into a train and the rabbit man was hurted ?  and something wanted to kill them but the rabbit man sacrificed himself to save ”Alice” (she had another name, but everyone called her Alice) OH! and another thing that i remember was this weird human chess game, with  powerfull people that controlled the people on the chessboard with electrodes in their heads, and this ”Alice” whats to liberate them but she get in trouble. Sorry if my english is not that good, my main languaje is spanish ? Thank you in andvance!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(miniseries)	Alice (miniseries)
136	I watched the film on VHS in the mid 90’s but it had an 80’s look to it. Was most definitely an indie flick. Was also in color.   An alien thing comes to earth via a meteorite (I believe) I recall it looking like a snake with just a mouth (parana type teeth) It squirms into a nearby village in central America. Climbs into a sleeping woman’s bed and up into her vagina. The creature causes her to have an increased sex drive. When a guy hooks up with her, the creature bites down and kills the guy. I don’t remember the specifics but the creature gained sustanace by killing and grew inside the woman. She thinks she’s killed the thing inside her and starts to hitch hike back home. a bus full of football players picks her up and the the awakens. I’m uncertain of the ending… If it shows her about to do the nasty with the team… Or if she incapacitates the driver and flips the bus to kill the creature.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Blood	Baby Blood
545	I watched this movie and remember parts of this – It is probably after 2000. Alien Invasion . Turns into girls. Tries to have sex with male characters in movie (Not Species). When kissed by aliens (Mouth to Mouth) the partner gets freezed. Lead girl is extremely hot (Now you know the reason) and wears specs. Thats all I remember.

604	SO, I remember a B&W movie I saw on TV in the 60’s where an alien spacecraft lands (maybe ‘crashes’ is better) in the desert near a small town.  The humanoid alien befriends (or is befriended by) a woman in town and they talk in her home.  People start getting killed on the outskirts of town, because some kind of alien creature had gotten aboard the craft, and the creature is hiding in a cave outside town.   When he hears of these killings, the humanoid alien recognizes that these are due to this creature, and he goes to try to kill it.  His hand weapon has been damaged (perhaps by the crash) and won’t work.  He disassembles it on her kitchen table, and finds a part that’s damaged.  He decides that the wires on poles running around town have power that might be able to operate his weapon to kill the creature.   The woman takes him out to the road near the cave, he climbs a telephone pole, cuts the wires and hooks them to his weapon.  She got on a nearby telephone, calls the local power company, where the guy at the power plant switches off the power as the alien is cutting the wires and connecting them to his weapon, and then turns the power back on, at her request over the phone. That’s what I remember, anyway… What’s the name of it?	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenagers_from_Outer_Space	Teenagers from Outer Space
292	This was a definite made-for-tv, low-budget movie I saw on the Sci-Fi Channel a few years ago.   A demolition crew is in the process of tearing up an old military base when they come across a hidden room. In the middle of the room there is a tomb-like vault. When they remove the top of the vault they find it full of water and a drowned test monkey (or maybe a person) with a strange plant growth coming out of it’s chest. They take photos and the light from the camera flash starts the plant growing at a fast pace, killing everyone it touches. The survivors reason that if the plant is growing this fast at night, then it will be unstoppable once the sun rises. One person realizes that the plant is actively avoiding him and it turns out that this guy’s blood acts like Roundup to the plant so he has to find his way back to the vault and kill it at the source.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Hell_(film)	Living Hell (film)
533	So I tried searching for this movie in google with the information that I remember and it actually brought me to this site. My dad rented this movie when I was a kid, it was probably around late 90’s early 2000’s I think. This is what I remember: it’s about a guy who’s either being hunted by aliens or tracking them (probably the later). At one point he’s running through a crowd of people at night in Mexico City during Day of the Dead. I think maybe at the end he finds their spaceship. I could be making that up but I’m pretty sure that happens, though.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arrival_(1996_film)	The Arrival (1996 film)
168	I was in the breakroom last night between 7 and 9 when I saw a bit of a movie/tv move/tv show with Ally Sheedy sitting across a (restaurant?) table talking to a much younger character. They begin speaking in French and he is telling her that he doesn’t love her like a mom. He’s in love with her. And she says that she knows. They talk about how they can never marry. He asks if they can go somewhere together.

903	I think it’s a famous movie or the actor is famous. There was a man in a hotel and I think he was in a Mafia project as a sudden and unwantedly. I remember two man came to him with a bag. The thing I remember is one day the woman in the cafe(cashier or waitress), he used to eat there everyday, was mad at him why he disregardes her! The man was a silent one as I remember(He had dialogues though) I watched it before 2013 and cause I watched a dubbed version I don’t know the original language.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Consequences_of_Love	The Consequences of Love
303	The movie starts like this, a man(say Alex, not exact name though) invents a machine that is used to into a criminally accused man’s mind and see his memories if he has really committed the crime or not. So one day, he goes into a man’s mind but this time the machine fails and Alex remains trapped in man’s mind virtually where he can travel any part of man’s memory remaining in coma physically. He notices a glitch that if the man remembers a memory and Alex also stays in same memory then Alex can interacts with him. By this he asks man to help him and fixes the machine and finally proves that man is innocents and gets out of his mind	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracted	Extracted
484	An American comedy movie. Main character is a famous person like a celebrity. For some reason in the movie, he needs a place to stay for one night. He comes across a married couple (he never met before) and asks them if he can take shelter at their home. The husband recognises him and is actually a big fan his, so he lets him stay. Some time later, the husband leaves the house to grab something. And when he comes back, he catches his wife seducing the celebrity. Eventually they have sex. Surprisingly, the husband is excited and overwhelmed that his idol is having sex with his wife. So he happily watches his wife cheat with the celebrity. Overall it’s a very funny and comedic scene.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Pro	Semi-Pro

660	Hopefully someone will recognise this as its been 20+ years since i saw it. So things I remember;  It was old style amine (think Thundercats style of animation) It was about a female operative on a mission She was incredibly stealthy There was a scene where she wiped out a number of generic guards and moved on but the movie stayed on scene for a little with one injured guard weeping for the death of her colleague (this struck me as very novel at the time). She fails the mission in a stupid way such as tripping up or similar and being killed. The second she is killed it switches back to her apartment where a massive flamethrower pops out of the ceiling light fitting and torches her entire place to wipe out any trace of her.  Hopefully I have remembered these correctly and someone will be able to help. G	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Æon_Flux	Æon Flux
1080	The movie, from what I remember; is about a male ghost dressed in Victorian era garments(full ruffled collar and embroidered suit) haunting his former mansion and still grief stricken about the loss of his wife from his former life. The only scene I remember is;  in order to get the ghost to show himself a man sets up a projector and projects an image of the ghosts’ wife. The ghost then appears and is mesmerized by the hologram like projection. The projection then stops and the ghost then becomes angered, yelling at the man to:  “bring her back!”  The man with the projection equipment then begins to collapse and appears to have a heart attack. The only other thing about this movie I remember is the ghost seems to bond with young girl who is in the mansion for some reason. I remember watching this movie a couple of times on television in the mid 90’s.  I’m not sure if it was a made for t.v. movie; but from the production quality I would assume it is from the 1980’s.  If anyone knows the title and can help me out I would be most appreciative.  I would love to watch this movie again and see if it is as good as I recall.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterville_Ghost_(1986_film)	The Canterville Ghost (1986 film)
252	A movie about a young girl being kidnapped and forced to dance in a club, but everytime she dances she imagines she’s in a different world to escape real life. This movie I saw approximately 3 years ago(2012) It was an English, color movie that described the life of a younger girl who taken from her home as a young girl. When she is older, she is forced to dance in a gentleman’s club. When she is chosen to do private dances, she closes her eyes and imagines a separate world. These worlds are always exciting and actiony, and always have a goal that relates back to a larger plan for her and the other dancers to escape the club. Some of the worlds range from a snowy mountain-top where she is fighting ninjas and samurai, to worlds where it is war-torn and in flames. In the end, only one of the girls escapes(She is not the main character described above). As she boards a bus, the driver(Who appears in every world the Main Character thinks up) welcomes her and we hear a voice-over that says something like “Sometimes you find out that you are not the main character of your own story. You are simply a supporting character in another’s.”	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_Punch_(2011_film)	Sucker Punch (2011 film)
645	Hello, I watched a movie very recently and I’m looking for a song from it but I don’t remember the title. It was an American film, in color, I don’t know the time frame but rather newer than older (though it seems to be set in the 90’s/00’s (I think? anyway, no smartphones)) and I don’t know any actors. It was on TV, late at night. The movie was quite disgusting, but it’s about a song. So the plot: I remember that there is a blonde girl with long hair. Her parents are divorced (her mum left) and she is at her mum’s house now, eating dinner/supper with her mum (scene is rather dark, in the evening). She is ‘teenager angry’ at her mum for not letting her go on a party (even though her dad let her) and goes to her room. There she decides to go anyway, she dresses up nicely, takes cab money and sneaks out. On the way to finding a taxi stop she is disturbed by a middle aged couple (later we find out that the woman is in a weird relationship with this mam, she has children with someone else, but isn’t allowed to see them, seems as if she is less of a psycho than him) in a car. They want to sell her weed, they are nagging her, but are trying to seem trustworthy. They propose that she goes with them to their house (because they’ve just run out of weed) and there she will be able to call a cab. She agrees and goes, at first she doesn’t want to enter, but then the woman gives her a cig, then propose alcohol, they talk, they seem nice, so finally she comes in. They drug her there (that’s when the song plays, the couple dances together while the girl realizes that something is wrong) and chain her to bed (she screams terribly). In the morning the mam leaves and the woman comes in to give her food, she tried to escape but can’t cause the woman threatens her with a knife. She asks why, tells her that her dad is a surgeon and has money. After all that, she is made write a letter to her mum that she run away (kinda because of her). Then she is supposed to go back to the room with the bed, but asks to go to the toilet, on their way there the man comes back (he was at the shop, he was stopped by some drug sellers about owing them money) and tells the woman to rest and that he will go to the toilet with the girl. The wife is jelaous, she knocks on the door of the toilet and starts kissing the man while the girl tries to escape. They hear the dog barking, noone is in the bathroom so they run to find her. She has been hiding in the tub, waiting for them to leave, she runs to the kitchen to grab a knife and then she tries to run away, but the man grabs her. Neighbours hear sth but the wife tells them to go away. Then the man blames the wife on this and tells her to go drop the letter off and but him sth. When she leaves he wants to rape the girl. There is a lot of screaming, he doesn’t get to it because she peed on him. The wife comes back and realizes and is mad, but silent. That’s all I’ve seen, cause I switched the program afterwards. At the same time there are scenes with the parents, they call each other, think she just is hungover after the party, but after a while they go to the police (the police tells them to come back another time because she probably is at a friend’s hous or sth). They find the letter, they argue, then the man asks the exwife to come back but she says that she will never come back and so the man leaves. That’s all I remember, I saw it the day before yesterday or sth, it isn’t anything recognizable. Please help, I really want this song, thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounds_of_Love_(film)	Hounds of Love (film)
272	a movie from the early 80’s late 70’s about a poor family in maybe tennessee or kentucky, could be a tv movie. siblings get split up and sent to state facilities, two brothers get sent to a boys school and get beat by the employees, one to where his legs are crippled. there’s a scene where the eldest sister has to gives one if the kids a tracheotomy on the side of a dirt road she uses a pocket knife. saw this movie in the early to mid eighties in color. female character brings to mind sissy spacek from coal miners daughter look but it’s not a film in her filmography on imdb.

273	This animated film was done I think in the 70s or early 80s, the only thing I can recall about it that I can put to any kind of words would be (possibly underwater) there is a can of either cat food or tuna where it zooms into the picture on the label which contains an image of the label itself and it keeps zooming into itself perpetually (the label on the label on the label etc) like when you put two mirrors side by side. I think it was shown on the Disney channel in the 80s and it may have involved some birds and a caterpillar… but I’m not entirely sure. Been bugging me for years if anyone has any ideas.

Also I think I remember but not sure, is that she tried to commit suicide and he saves her. It was winter time, there was snow outside. And there was a scene at some house party maybe.

543	I saw this movie in theaters when I was little, to late 90s. It was an animation movie starred by foxes. I dont remember much about it but I think the protagonist fighting to the alpha fox, which was the main villain of the film (or so I remember it), overcame him and became the leader of the pack. Perhaps the film was an exploitation of “Balto”, by the success of that other movie. I dont know if the film was American or European but the animation style was Disney/Universal. Its possible that part o f the movie happens in winter, with snow, but I’m not sure. I remember my family and I were in a car and we passed near of a movie theater. We could see the posters advertising films and I was struck animated foxes poster, so I asked my mother, my grandmother and my great-grandmother to stop and go to the theater. The film had already started but we went anyway. Does anyone know what movie would it be?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Fox	The Little Fox
1074	Hello, Well, I just cant get this movie out of my mind, from time to time I remember some scenes so clearly but I cant find anything on google. Its a ANIMATED MOVIE where a man goes to space (to the Moon I think) and leaves his little daughter on earth. He then returns to planet earth, like 20 years later or something, way older, but guess what, he “brings” some aliens with him and the rest of the movie is basically them evil aliens attacking humans. So yeah, its a “adult” animated movie if I remeber correctly with some weird scenes. The scene I remeber the most, is when that old man returns, the first thing he does: he basically gets out of his spacecraft, falls down on the ground, unzips his pants, and laying down on his back starts peeing upwards or something. Yep, some weird stuff. I remember watching it years ago alone, late at night on TV, and I was just a kid (so, maybe 10/15 years ago), but more and more I’m thinking it might just have been a (very) weird dream, but some of the scenes are so clear in my mind still to this day that I doubt that. I dont remember the language of the movie but Im pretty sure it was in color. Thanks.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_Aliens	Mutant Aliens
1052	Nya, I saw this movie on television in the late 90s. It was 2D animation. Surely it was a film of 80s or 90s. Maybe it was American or Canadian. It was starring by a girl who lived in Australia, and a dog named Laika. I dont know if this Laika was the original Laika who travelled to the space in the 50s or the name is in honor of the real astronaut dog. I think the girl spoke at the beginning of the film with the australian animals, such as kangaroos and koalas. The girl and her animal friends were trying to save the dog to prevent the scientists sent she onto the space, but the plan went wrong and the girl was trapped inside the rocket with the dog and his friends saw the rocket taking off helplessly. The rocket had landed on another planet inhabited by extremely fat aliens, egg-shaped. Maybe the aliens were balloons. During the rest of the movie the girl and the dog tried to help the prince of aliens and find a way to return to the earth, while an evil alien who hates them try to end the life of the prince to rule the alien kingdom.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_in_Space	Dot in Space
828	I remember watching an animated movie in the years 2009-2015. I don’t remember the name or any of the actors of the movie, but I remember a lot about it. First off, it was animated. It wasn’t super high quality, the people/things looked like silhouettes (you couldn’t see their faces or exact clothing details, but you could see the shadows of them). Second, it was about a boy and a girl acting out these “plays” in an old theater owned by an old man, who may have been their grandfather. There was also an owl in the theater, and it looked at the camera and hooted whenever they changed from one “play” to another. Third, to change from one costume to another, they stood on a sort of platform thing. It “scanned” them, and the silhouettes of the clothes they described appeared on their bodies. The plays/plots I remember are as follows : Boy gets put in prison (wrongly accused of stealing a necklace, I think), but gets pitied by a princess and she takes him food/clothing. However, the good princess’s evil sister tries to marry the boy when he gets out of prison. When he refuses/realizes she’s the evil princess, she curses him to be a wolf. Boy then eventually gets freed by the good princess. Boy finds himself in a city of gold, but an evil dragon rules the city. The dragon gives the people gold, but only if they sacrifice the most beautiful maiden to the dragon every month/year. Boy eventually slays dragon and marries the girl, who was the most beautiful at that time. Boy is in Africa/similar place and likes to play the drum, but is shunned for doing so. The girl’s father is the clan/tribe chief and is dying from illness. Boy gets thrown out of clan/tribe, but saves an old medicine man from a leopard/big cat. Old medicine man teaches boy how to play drum, which ends up healing the sick clan/tribe chief. The drum also makes the clan/tribe unbeatable in battle. Boy is an adventurer in a strange land where he crawls through a tunnel and gets put in prison. He has to choose/marry one of the king’s three daughters, but he doesn’t know which one. A bee flies around the head of the correct daughter because he fed the bee earlier in the tunnel. He also gets help from other monsters he met in the tunnel/cave. There may have been more, but it’s been years since I saw the movie. It was	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Night_(film)	Tales of the Night (film)
174	I remember watching this movie in the United States in the mid-90s in English but what I remember of the animation makes me think it might have been dubbed from Japanese. I remember renting the VHS and watching it at home, and I think I remember it having a full story arc so I don’t think it was an episode of a television series. The main character was some kind of musician or conductor. At some point he is in a normal/”real” world, and at some point he is in some strange/trippy world. This is where he encounters the strange, black, humanoid blob creature, who is sort of maliciously gleeful. At the end, the main character has to save the day by conducting music in this strange world to defeat a monster or something. The only other detail I recall is a minor character, a young woman, maybe a violin or string player, though I don’t recall her relevance. (The main character may have been interested in her romantically? Or she may have just been a background character.) Any and all help is appreciated! This has been driving me up a wall for years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Journey_Through_Fairyland	A Journey Through Fairyland
144	I remember watching this movie in the 90’s. I can remember the movie as being animated with typical cartoon human characters. I remember one of the first scenes as having a boy being chased by a steam locomotive pulling a train of passenger cars. The train chases him across a lake. The boy escapes to his home, then answers a knock at the door only to see that it is the train. He wakes up from the dream, picks up a toy locomotive and mutters, “Trains”. The film was, I believe, a Christmas type film and was a bit on the dark side as far as those films go. Maybe someone else has seen it?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nemo:_Adventures_in_Slumberland	Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland
212	I saw this movie on TV on a channel which broadcast children’s programs and British, Russian, Hungarian, etc. animation (Like “Count Duckula” “Penny Crayon”, “The Family Ness”, “Willy the Sparrow”…) and American animation films little known, as “The railway dragon”. This movie was 2D animation and I saw it in the late 90’s or early 2000s, so probably was made in the 80s or early 90s. I’m not sure if the movie is american or european. The film is starred by a boy who was coward. In company of another character he began a fantastic journey, I think into the world of dreams. Maybe the child was afraid by nightmares. At the end of the film appeared the villain, the King of Nightmares, an evil doppelganger of the child. He looked exactly like the child but with gloves and slippers clawed monster, similar to this: http://www.wynsors.com/images/6163096.jpg I think this character appeared in the room of the protagonist. After defeat the king of nightmares he overcome one’s fear too and he dont be afraid again. I’m not sure but I guess that the child was black. Definitely is not “Little Nemo in Slumberland”, neither an episode of “Midnight Patrol”.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilus_the_Sandman	Nilus the Sandman
798	The only thing I remember about this movie is the ending. The movie ends with a man who appears to be normal walk past a woman who asks if he’s okay. He answers yes and walks past her to the bathroom. After closing the door, he stares into the mirror for a while before hitting the mirror with his fist and screaming/laughing hysterically. I remember a friend mentioning that he did never came back. The movie was filmed before 2012 for sure. I know it’s very vague but I really want to re-watch this movie!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks	Twin Peaks
335	An old movie seen during 1990s on TV. I think it was in english and in color . The airplane of a family fall in a strange area. there is a scene of introducing disgusting food; eyes in soup. And a scene of putting a man in metal cage then in fire.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
608	This was from the 80s. I’m not sure if it was a story from a series like ” tales from the crypt” , ” the hitchhiker”, ” the creepshow”, or just a random thriller. The scenes I remember was a few young adults or older teenagers end up at this home with a very odd family that pretends their corpse daughter is still alive and they want these visitors to play with her. And one point one female visitor is on a cliff or ridge trying to flee from one of the crazy men and he accidentally kills her (head trauma) then he rips her shirt open to see her breasts. When he goes back to his crazy family they knew what he had done so the whip him while saying the Lord’s prayer. It was so weird and I only seen it as a child. I’d like to research it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gothic_(1988_film)	American Gothic (1988 film)
427	Anybody remember a movie with a whistling killer and a sadistic future prison? Anybody remember a movie with a gang of intruders and one of the killers whistling a tune? They break into a house and kill the wife of the main character. The computer of the security system of the house declares: INTRUDERS IN THE HOUSE. INTRUDERS IN THE HOUSE. The man is wrongfully accused of the murder and sentenced to a sadistic prison. This all is happening in the future. The convicts are hanging from a bar with their hands and whoever falls down is electrocuted by the floor. I saw this movie in the late 80s. It was the first movie I ever saw on VHS.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_of_the_Year_2072	Warriors of the Year 2072
481	Anyone remember an old B&W movie where a guy rents out a flat but hides under floor board and kills the tenants. Many many years ago when I was about 6 (now over 50) I sneaked and watch a movie after being put to bed. I should not have been watching this movie as I think it was responsible for my claustrophobia. I can’t remember a lot about it except for the fact that a guy rents out a flat but hides under the floorboards and murders the occupants. At the end of the movie he is still under the floorboards when a new couple comes to view the flat. They move a wardrobe and unknowingly trap the guy under the floorboards. I just remember him being trapped in a small space screaming for help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snorkel	The Snorkel
668	This was a stalker thriller from the 80’s or possibly early 90’s. WPIX in NY used to air it. A young married woman is on a road trip and has an affair with a drifter. Her husband, whose name is Arthur, is having her followed by a private investigator. When she returns home, the drifter won’t leave her alone, and she is trying to break it off with him. The woman works in an office, and her boss ids an African American man. She is also being mysteriously stalked as well. It turns out that she is being stalked by the private investigator. The private investigator also killed her husband. The private investigator torments her and says, “I’m the most dangerous man you have ever met.” Then, the drifter breaks in and violently kills the private investigator.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifter_(1988_film)	The Drifter (1988 film)
141	Rented from video store early to mid 90’s It was about a family that had an apple orchard. It was a mother, father, and 2 brothers. The mother somehoe (I don’t remember) turns into a monster and the family keeps her in the basement. At one point, an inspector or cop goes into the basement, and she ends up being right behind him for a decent scare. The father and older brother turn into monsters at the end, the little brother does not. It may have been the apples that did it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_(1987_film)	The Curse (1987 film)
508	I could have sworn I saw this in elementary school in the 80s on VHS, it was mostly likely a production from that time or the 60s or 70s.  It’s not quite a movie, more like a short.  It could have been its own production, or part of a larger collection. Anyway, it’s set in a desert-region, probably the sahara or india, or somwhere over there……and there’s this arab prince or something, and i guess he’s wealthy to some extent, and he lives in this palace (or at least a very big house).  i think his father dies, and on his deathbed, his father tells him not to open “the door”, which is a big wooden door with iron hinges and locks, which features prominently in the house. now, why he never opened it before this, i’m not sure, but it’s been shut and/or locked until now, so whatever. anyway, his father dies, and the son is seen eating grapes or fruit or something and then he notices the door, and goes over and opens it. he goes down into a dungeon of sorts, and down a dark hallway and suddenly this big huge man with no shirt (kind of like the big bald guy that Indiana Jones fights in Raiders of the Lost Ark) appears out of nowhere, picks him up and dumps him in the middle of the desert for to be left for dead. i always wondered why he doesn’t just go back the way he came, or back to his palace (which is presumably close by) i don’t know.  but you get the impression he’s now a long way away from anything. so he crawls around the desert a bit, and then gets picked up by this beautiful princess and her entourage, and she has him come and stay with her in her palace, and life is great.  but the princess also warns the prince not to open “the door” — because she has a door in her palace living room that looks just like the one that he had!!  big wooden door with iron hinges and all. wtf. ok, so this guy is more curious than george, and he goes over and opens it, goes down the hallway, and suddenly the same big bald man appears and picks him up and dumps him out into the middle of the desert again. as he’s sitting there in the sand, he sees a vision of sorts of the princess riding off on the horizon with her entourage on camels, and she’s basically scolding him about opening the door, and now she’s not going to be with him. somehow, the prince ends up back in his palace again, and the final shot is of him sitting in the living room eating his grapes again, and the camera pans over to “the door”.   the narrator says something cryptic and spooky about having learned his lesson about the door or something like that. It sounds like it could have come from One Thousand and One Nights, or Ali Baba, or Sinbad, or Aladdin, but I have been thus far unable to determine what it was….	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storybook_International	Storybook International
346	So the movie was about a single mother of a daughter and a younger son (there maybe one more child or no) she hires a male housekeeper/nanny who she falls in love with. Theres a scene where the woman is taking a shower and dries herself on a wall that shoots out air or something and the man walks in by accident. The daughter is really withdrawn and wants to be a designer when she grows up. Theres even a scene where she puts on a home fashionshow where the man and the brother put on clothes she made. In the last scene theyre all sitting at a table and the man gets up to carve the turkey. Thats all i remember. Its probably an old movie. I saw it when i was really young.help?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_the_Butler	Bob the Butler
394	I have not seen it for about 10 years, dont know any actors.. Movie covers few intertwined stories in kinda cold and depressing atmosphere. One of them is about a girl who works as maid, and she was involved in a traffic accident and recovers afterwards. The man she working for thought that she stole his watch as he couldnt find it, but it was in a drawer at his home. Another story portrays man going through divorce, and waves at some woman in another subway train at the end of the movie. Another bit i remember is man who has addict son and pays bail for him. Student asks his physics professor for better grade as he wants to study medicine but doesnt get it, and commits suicide(other students speculate it). Always happy fatty gets fired, but his ex-collegue finds him a new job which he is again happy with. One of their collegues wins a lottery and quits. Just very touching an subtle movie(as far as I remember) thank	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Conversations_About_One_Thing	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing
449	Color, most likely. Possibly cartoon. I remember a girl was going to be married to someone, but she didn’t want to. She pretended to act disgusting when called down to dinner. She says things like “oh, food!” and starts eating it. The guards probably are staring at her and she looks up. “What are you looking at?” Eventually, she goes up on the chandeliers. “I always wanted to do this!” One of the servants looks up and says to himself “I always wanted to do that, too…” Then someone comes in and she stops.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Phantom	Danny Phantom
313	So I saw this movie my freshman year in art class. Black and white , some color and it was in english. It was about this little gilt that lived with her dad in a small apartment. She had a lot of drawings in her walls. She somehow she gets sucked into the drawing world and the girl from in there comes to her real word. In there there is a lot of fictional characters and I remember when she meets a dude with like a face like piccaso and they go to a library and the books fly she needs to be strong to hold them. There is a queen tjat is looking for her and the dude is taking her to her and when she finds the girl she is the princess so inside weird looking creatures dress her and do her makeup . They are in a castle type thing with legs and it’s just walking and the queen has like dark magic or something .   	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MirrorMask	MirrorMask
525	Saw the trailer at a local theater some time ago: the main characters are a couple (with a cat i think?) and they are experiencing relationship  problems and kind of a dullness in their live. The woman looked like Annie Clark .                                  The couple kept repeating that they were already 5 years together and at one point the woman told an older woman about it in a dialogue with a meaning like this (roughly): Woman: I don’t understand, we’re already 5 years together, I mean we’re not at the beginning anymore. Older woman: 5 years is just the beginning.  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Future_(film)	The Future (film)
1081	I saw it around 2000s, it is a movie in color. There was these prisoner working outside maybe, digging something and the sheriff decided to kill them. and cover them in cement. They came back from the dead to kill the sheriff and also one of the prisoners son was in danger maybe.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_666_(film)	Route 666 (film)
467	I can’t remember whether or not the movie was subtitled but it was one of those stereotypical Asian fighting movies along the lines of House of the Flying Daggers but it was a total spoof. One of the most memorable moments was this female assassin was “transferring” her title and knowledge of fighting to a younger female assassin (the title was something about a white/green snake?) and they literally look at each other and a file download (think old microsoft pop up when you moved a file from one folder to another) popped up and showed the “data” being transferred from the older woman to the younger woman. I think it was made in the early 2000s, maybe late 90s.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Dragon_(film)	The White Dragon (film)
722	Asian cop in an old-style small village.  He trains his penis by thrusting it into a sandbag and putting it on a wooden block and hitting it with rocks.  It sounds pretty bad but it was a decent cop movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanzo_the_Razor	Hanzo the Razor
926	I rented this film in the early 2000’s.  It was in color, and may have been a Japanese film, but I can’t be sure.  The plot involves a series of murders, where the “killer” mysteriously gets other people to kill.  After the killings, this man disappears, and the people cannot remember why they killed who they did.  The first murder is a regular customer killing a prostitute.  When the police show up, the man is distraught because he has no memory of the murder. Before the second murder, a man meets the killer on a beach.  The killer says he is lost, I think, and so the man takes the killer home with him.  The man’s wife is asleep upstairs while the two of them engage in a strange conversation.  I think the killer mentions the color of the man’s wife’s niughtgown.  The man kills his wife, and then tries to kill himself when he realizes what he has done.  He first tries to kill himself by throwing himself out a window.  he then tries to kill himself in the police station by running head-first into a wall.  The cop chasing the killer has a sick wife, and eventually catches up to him.  However, I think the killer ends up escaping.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure_(film)	Cure (film)
1014	I’m searching for the name of a possibly Hong Kong Crime/Thriller from the 80’s or 90’s. The scene that I remember is A woman is coming downstairs at a hospital while a nurse carrying medicine/needle on a tray is walking upstairs. She follows the nurse, handgags the nurse and drags her into the very first room on that floor. In a few seconds, the woman comes out of the hospital room wearing the nurse’s clothes and hospital facial mask. (Probably carrying the tray too) The next scene shows nurse is tied up with virtually no clothes on and gagged. She struggled aggressively. The next scene shows some men in suits standing in the hallway outside a hospital room. I think the woman in disguised is trying to get inside to kill the hospitalized person. Anyone has any idea what movie this is?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Hunter:_Prelude_to_Murder	Lady Hunter: Prelude to Murder
240	Hello, this movie title will be a difficult one. It surely was an asian movie I used to watch when I was a kid at least 25 years ago. I am not sure about its age even back then but it was a color movie though. There was a sentient ship computer (or core) of a crashed/landed alien ship resembling a big emerald. There was a group of bad guys (the boss was a europan dude) who took it from the ship for some surely bad purpose. Then there was this group of young asian people trying to help it get back to the ship, but not before they had some fun with it. I remember the computer could alter reality for you when you were close enough to it – like this one time when one of the boys was voyeuring a girlfriend behind a window and asking the computer to make her strip down. It granted him the wish but in the end it appeared as if she was peeling away her skin to reveal a lizard one underneath, the dude was shocked and fell of a window. Then I remember the final fighting scene taking place in some ancient ruins where the ship was hidden and the evil boss using two sais (ninja weapons resembling small tridents).  The computer “died” in the end, but not before “giving birth” to its smaller successor. I tried to find it using google, searched a number of databases with sci-fi movies from 1960s-1990s with no success. But the databases are not that perfect as I did not notice them to list another movie from my childhood called “Gunhed/Ganheddo” from 1989. Any old-timer remembering this one? ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Crystal	The Magic Crystal
862	The movie is set around 1920s-60s. There is a circus which most of the performers are freaks and thier boss is an old midget. There is a young girl who is a performer there was killed by her boyfriend (or so I think), her father rally the circus people to take vengeance on her killer. That is all I can remeber.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivàle	Carnivàle
119	From what I remember it involved 3-4 astronauts.  One stays in orbit (a black man), while the others go to the surface of this planet. The ones on the surface are there to retrieve data (from probes perhaps?). The astronauts on the surface only have a limited time to collect this data and get back to the ship in orbit.  I think something happens to shorten their time there (a storm maybe?).  During this scene they were surrounded by water if I remember correctly. The female (possibly the crew leader?) keeps saying she can finish the data collection in time because it’ll be ages before they can get another chance.  She says this despite the warnings from her comrades to just leave.  Well, they miss their chance to get back to the ship in orbit. Now the kicker is that the time on the planet’s surface is vastly different to the time in orbit.  For instance, on the surface perhaps only a few hours pass, but in orbit several years pass.  I think it ends up being something like 20+ years to the man in orbit before the surface crew gets back. Anyone know what this movie is?  I watched it in the last 3 years, but I streamed it so the movie itself could be older.  Although I don’t think it would be more then say ten years old.  It’s in colour, an American film in English.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)	Interstellar (film)
1047	I saw this movie while I was in middle school, early 80s.  It was American.  A lab is working on a time machine, and the main scientist is an older woman.  They bring an ape, or maybe an early prehistoric man into the present.  It’s a serious movie, not a comedy or anything like that.  I remember that the woman forms a bond because the ape shows unusual intelligence and emotion, but other scientists are the generic uncaring types who want to dissect him or whatever.  The thing I remember the most is that the woman tries to escape from the lab with the ape, but they are chased by a helicopter, and I think getting shot at, and the only way to escape is for both of them to jump into the time machine chamber and she goes back to whatever-BC with the ape.  I have been trying to find this movie for years, with no luck!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_Little_Boy#Television_adaptation	The Ugly Little Boy#Television adaptation
934	I vaguely remember a bit weird Australian movie about a teenage girl who argued with her parents, her mom in particular. She kinda lived in her own world daydreaming and masturbating often. And there was a scene where her mother told her to set the table for lunch and as she was doing it she starts to rub her vagina on the corner of the table and closes her eyes in ecstasy and then her mom catches her doing it and is outraged. Think the movie is from the 90’s. Also, but not sure if I remember it correctly there was something about flies.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistful_of_Flies	Fistful of Flies
1049	I saw this movie in the early 90’s on tv.  I think the setting was in Australia.  The movie started in a single room school house in the outback when some thugs came and took them and led them to find something.  It  goes through their adventure of the school children of varying ages and their female teacher taking care of each other, surviving, aluding their captors and overcoming them.  I remember the final scene back in the school house with a body part in a glass container.  I loved the survival aspect of it and how they worked together.  I wish I could see it again.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_(1985_film)	Fortress (1985 film)
1077	So, the movie is about this weird virus or something that infects people, the infected people look for other people and try to vomit on them in order to infect them. There was this one scene I remember when the main female character (I think) was going somewhere, she tried to act so the infected wouldn’t notice her, but an infected policeman did, instead of infecting her he warned her to try not to be stressed and not to sweat. The movie has this motif about sweat, that the infected don’t sweat. I think the movie is from before 2008 and I’m pretty sure it’s English but I might be wrong.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invasion_(film)	The Invasion (film)
369	One of its posters shows a man waving a sheet of white cloth. The movie is about two soldiers (probably), each is an enemy to the other. They are stuck to each other at the front line or something. They behaved as enemies to each other at the beginning, and eventually came to realize otherwise. I saw the movie like 15-18 years ago. I saw it on DVD but I think the movie was from around that time. I think it was an European movie, and not in English. I’ve been confused the movie with “Welcome to Salajevo” for a long time, which I saw around the same time.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Land_(2001_film)	No Man%27s Land (2001 film)
788	I saw only this scene, on YouTube or Vimeo a long time ago, it looked like an excerpt from a movie, they are in a bedroom, a woman and a guy (wich is tied to a chair), she for some reason needs to find out what is his “secret” or what turns him on, she said that she tried every kind of fetish and weird stuff but nothing worked, at an last attempt she start to talk to him about kids in a playground and then the gets excited, so her mission is “completed” and she takes a briefcase and leave.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphomaniac_(film)	Nymphomaniac (film)
1054	I saw part of this film that my friend hired about 10 years ago and never got a chance to see the title. It was in full-color, English-speaking film. Mellow and a bit tragic in genre – probably rated M. The main character was quiet, young  guy (roughly 20) who was bald and very pale. There was something  slightly supernatural about him. Evident in a scene where he’s tagging along on a hunting trip. He strongly disapproves of the activity because of the killing and after seeing a deer be shot, but not fatally, he transfers the panicked feeling from the deer to the shooter by putting his hands on them both. The film ends with him (spoiler alert) running across  field under a thunder storm and being struck by lighting. Any help recalling this would be cool. Thanks in advance.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(film)	Powder (film)
666	Hello everyone. I usually visit this site to help find a film but today I need some help myself. The film I’m looking for is in color, made in Italy in the 1960’s, badly dubbed and colorful in that inimitable Italian SF way. I believe the title has letters or numbers in it, possibly something like “Spaceship XB-1.” It begins as a spy movie with Italian agents and possibly an american agent trying to keep something from Chinese agents. The Chinese agents are played for laughs. The movie also has scientists investigating an alien spaceship and when the ship opens up the spies and scientists are captured and abducted, taken on a journey across the cosmos by the aliens. The captain of the spaceship is a woman and she ends up learning about love with one of the humans. They travel across space and have encounters and adventures, eventually reaching the planet from whence the aliens came only to find it deserted with a monument explaining how they all destroyed themselves in a war. There’s a crappy model of an abandoned city with dust blowing through it and dramatic music (Beethoven if I remember correctly) intercut with them reading the monument. This is a very bad, very cheesey movie (as Italian scifi tends to be) and I am looking for it specifically to write a review for a b-movie site. Any help would be appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Pilot	Star Pilot
108	I saw this movie in the 90s, it might be created between 1980 and 1995.  It was on VHS tape Colored US movie Plot: At the first half maybe at the beginning of the movie there was a princess/queen/sorceresses who dressed in long skirt in the colors of rainbow, she wasn’t a fighter, but she held something important according the plot Plot: At the second half of the movie a barbarian horde helped the princess to escape from the army of an evil emperor. Due the size of the army the barbarians (6-12 barbarian) remained one by one (sometimes two of them) to uphold the army in order to save time to the refugees. At the end of the movie I think only one or two man remained with the princess but they also scarified their lives in order to save the girl  My memories could be a little bit blurred, but I am quite sure about the characters (barbarians and the princess).

823	I remember watching this cartoon as a kid, and I’m pretty sure I had it on VHS. It kind of had a Barbie vibe, only the main character was a brunette. I think it was a few short movies in one.

110	Saw this in about 2009. I think it starts out on a beach with a couple having a wedding, and the women loses her ring in shore but finds it later later and then sees a massive tsunami coming. I remember this guy and a women speeding in a car to try and get to some facility in time, and get pulled over by police, but lie to the officer that they’re on their way to a honey moon, which they are very excited about so he lets them off the hook. I remember they went over a tsunami in a speedboat. And there was this evil genius guy eating pineapple chunks in a dark room on a computer.. At the end the guy made it to this facility where they were going to launch these underwater missiles to cause a catastrophic tsunami and so he pretended to be one of them, and foiled their plans by adjusting something on a computer, and got beaten up after the bad guy found out what he was up to and told him to fix it at gun point. This good guy pointed at some consoles and told him to shoot them so he’d run out of ammo, to buy himself some time. And then the good guy and the bad guy were sitting there poetically together having a heart to heart accepting their impending doom. Just annoying me that I can’t find this movie, so thanks for any suggestions.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Wave	Killer Wave
361	It was the mid 90s, shown on a PBS channel. It was a highly dysfunctional Asian American family. There was a mother, father, twin brothers; one was a drug dealer with a girlfriend who turned out to be an space alien and the other stayed in his room alone with a rocking horse and masturbated to skinhead imagery, and a younger teenage sister who was slutty. Movie ends in a violent clash with skinheads, alien abduction, and a sleazy lawyer tricking the teenage girl into running away with him (he was going to exploit her in porn). There were a lot blurring of explicit scenes with the girl and some violent imagery. I was shocked as a teenager to find this on a PBS channel, but also fascinated to see a film starring Asian Americans and a really disturbing a bizarre plot (not a terrible film, acting was very decent). Haunts me to this day, really wish I could put a name to it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_USA	Terminal USA
362	I remember seeing a move trailer several years ago, but I can’t remember exactly when it was playing.  The trailer (I THINK, because all this info is from memory) was a man talking over a speaker to someone who appeared to be in some sort of puzzle game/maze/weird environment with strange colors and a very bizarre esthetic.  I remember seeing a lot of bright colors and a guy with white hair-keep in mind this was a while ago and my memory of it isnt complete) I believe it was a foreign film but if I remember correctly, they were playing the trailer at some major american movie theaters.  It very much reminded me of A Clockwork Orange/Dark side of the moon type visual experience.  I think it was within the last 10 years but I could be wrong.

115	Netflix within three years ago. Colour. English. Cinematography suggests somewhere around the 90s. I saw a movie a while back and I can’t find it again. It was weird and dark, very Tim Burtony. It’s an inn or boardinghouse by the sea. The residents ate crappy food and that’s what kept them ill. They started eating better food and started getting better. There was a bit about a boat at the end of the pier, but I can’t remember.

It was black and white movie about a small group becoming stranded on a island. Somehow a small number can be rescued as the group realizes the cannibals are closing in.  An older couple and the anti hero (who I think was Peter Lorrie) are left behind with a gun with two bullets.

674	I have very few memories from this movie.  The problem is I thought it was called Blazing Saddles and that’s clearly not the case.  Probably saw it on TV.  90s or early 2000s.  An older man (main character) has sex with a woman (younger) and he’s wearing cowboy boots while he does it.  Her legs might be in the air.   I think it might have taken place in the south.  Kind of an obnoxious spoof sort of movie maybe.  I have a vague recollection of a “Boss Hog” sort of feel only a thin man.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_(1989_film)	Blaze (1989 film)

702	Hi, I spend almost 10 years of finding the movie title, but cant find it anywhere, it is really frustrating. I saw the movie when i was 13 i believe (1995) . It was english spoken and in color it involves an adolescent boy that lives in a shitty house and his mother is on drugs. In the end he burned the house down with his mother still insight, the kid was completly insane and smoked ciggarettes ( i think he was 14 or 15 years old) i believe he was a red haired white boy that walked much in the movie with a hoodie on (grey)  …   My memory of this movie goes away with the years …  .. I know it was a really f*cked up movie when i saw it, and i wanna see it again .. If you have anny idea please let me know ..

549	I recall a movie I saw the last quarter of on TV back in the early 90’s.  It wasn’t of great quality, and I didn’t love it or anything, but it’s memory stuck with me.  I thought the name was ‘The Scribe” or “The Herald” of what I watched a boy with a dark cloak and 3 I think gentlemen following him, escaped a medieval style Hell,  I recall seeing some rather freakish sights behind them as they climbed into a cave where behind them was fire and lava, and a flying skeleton demon coming after them.  They proceeded to rush through the cave and find themselves in the sewer of a city in the states, where they seem to be on a quest to get to a specific chapel, before the demons snatch them back and kill them.  I think the boy dies at the end along with the men.  The tone of the movie was dark of course. If someone remembers and can help me out, that’d be great	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Navigator:_A_Medieval_Odyssey	The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey
429	This is a movie I saw about 10 years ago, it was in English with colour. It was about a kid who is on some train (I think it might have been some locomotive) and he is in a compartment with two other guys. Eventually the kid falls asleep and dreams that some one is after him for some reason. The two guys in the compartment are also in his dream and can change into some big dogs. They are also after him. I do not know what else happens in the dream, but at the end of the movie the kid wakes up and is all like ‘oh, it was just a dream’! The two other guy in the compartment get off and the boy sees them walking across some fields and then they turn into dogs for a split second before they are gone. That is all I remember of the movie. I also remember that it left me feeling kinda scared	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Box_of_Delights_(TV_series)	The Box of Delights (TV series)
1091	I remember watching this movie on TV in the late 80’s (possibly early 90’s). It was in English and in colour. I can only remember the beginning and the end. There were two boys (in their early teens) and one was in love with his teacher. The best friend was a science geek and invented a machine that ages things (demonstrated by growing a plant from seed in a few seconds). The machine was used on boy number 1 and turned him into an adult. He used this opportunity to become a substitute teacher at the school to get closer to his teacher. It ended with boy 1 at his normal age. He goes to class and his teacher is sitting in his best friend’s desk. She is turned into a girl his age and his best friend enters the classroom as an adult to fill in for her. He starts giving a lecture by holding up a seed and says something about possibilities. I have been trying to figure out this one on my own for years with no luck.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_Going_on_30	14 Going on 30
710	I remember this (Japanese?) animated movie that I watched about 15 years ago on TV… It is about a boy who “finds” a swimming baby dinosaur (don’t know exactly what the species is called – it’s the Nessy type, I think!) – maybe it’s an egg first and hatches later. The dinosaur’s mother has been stranded on the beach of an (tropical?) island or some coast and its HUUUGE carcass/skeleton is discovered by the public! Later on, the baby dinosaur is abducted by some scientists, but the boy is able to rescue it and punches one of them in the face (or something along those lines). Sadly, that’s all I can remember. Can you help me? ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T?i_Umi_kara_Kita_Coo	T?i Umi kara Kita Coo
280	I saw this movie a while ago probably early to mid 90’s. I can remember that it was a coming of age film with these boys who are growing up in I think the 50’s maybe New York. The scene that has always stuck with me was when this boy was sweeping up in this house I seem to remember it being in a basement. This older woman comes in and propositions this young boy by telling him to go up stairs to her room to get some money on the night stand, I think she’s a lonely doctors wife. The kid runs away I think.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Bits	Two Bits
562	Two kids (both boys) are seen playing in a bedroom and with a gun that one of the kids found (I believe in that room).  The boy shoots him (who he was friends with) accidentally and it ends up killing him. I remember the boy that was shot falling into the closet and just laying there. After, police end up coming and I believe they start questioning the kid. Both the kids were young, I say early teens if not younger. I’m really not sure whether it was a movie or part of a tv show.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestories:_Families_in_Crisis	Lifestories: Families in Crisis
854	hello guys, its my first post here. i am describing as much as details i can remember to know the movie name. so please help so i saw the trailer of this  movie sometime in 2016 or 2017. its goes like few guys go out for a nightout and they go to a club, possibly a strip club, could be a brothel also. here, one of these guys finds a girl/woman who is held in a hostage like situation and she pleads him for help. once he does help her out, she unleashes a disaster at the place. she has a tail from what i can remember and is not a normal human being. the guy is terrified and they breakout of the place. the owner of the place who had locked her goes on hunting for the woman. thats all i could recollect. please help in finding the name of the movie. its not a big budget movie. thanks.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(film)	Siren (film)
899	This movie was in full color, in English, and I watched it sometime in October of this year. This boy had to stay with a strange family; the father was a doctor, which I remember because the daughter of the family played doctor with the boy by using her father’s shock therapy equipment (but they didn’t have time to electrocute him). The girl and the guy were planning on running away together by the end of the movie, though I’m not sure if they went through with this plan. The boy’s mother is schizophrenic; there was one scene where all of the silver and tableware had been set on the lawn, and another where she was hallucinating that it was snowing inside her house. Any ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_with_Scissors_(film)	Running with Scissors (film)
824	I remember it was like in the 2000’s and it was on the tele. It was about 2 boys and one of them got hte power to slow down time and im pretty sure he started to grow a lot faster and later on he gets hunted down by aliens because i think he took something of theirs which gave him the powers. If you think you know what this is please comment.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyrunners	Skyrunners
621	The movie has 2 best friends who go to school together, one invents a machine to make fruit/vegetables really big (trying to solve world hunger I think) and the other friend then uses it on himself to become an adult. He then goes to the school and is mistaken for a teacher/head teacher? He falls in love with the teacher he had a crush on and she falls in love with him. Eventually he gets turned back into a teenage boy – but it all ends happily when she gets turned into a teenage school girl… and I think the genius best friend turns himself into an adult. I watched this in the early 90’s so my guess is that it was made sometime from the mid 80’s on.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_Going_on_30	14 Going on 30
727	I remember a cartoon movie about a boy who’s town and mother got captured by colorful hyenas that go by a specific name. He had to go on this long journey to find a wizard who could defeat the hyenas, and along the way he met a wolf who turns into a human, a little pink bunny-like creature, and a guy with a mosquito living on his shoulder.  The bunny guy comes upon  a tribe of Indian guys who worship him because he looks like their god. They eventually found the wizard, but before they met him/her the mosquito guy said that wizards are old guys with long beards. They meet the wizard who turns out to be a little girl. They ask her to defeat the hyenas, and she gives him a mirror. He realizes that he has the power inside him to defeat the hyenas. He releases his whole town and his mother and they all live. That’s all that I remember. This will bug me until I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Warrior%27s_Tail	A Warrior%27s Tail

337	I would like to find out the name of a film I saw years ago. It was one of those late 1950’s or early 1960’s British crime films. It was in black and white. One of the early scenes is the ringleader sends out half a banknote to a handful of criminals with a letter telling them that they can get the other half of the banknote if they meet up at a rendezvous. The plan is to then either to retrieve some previously hidden cash stash or do another robbery….I can’t quite remember the plot. Possibly Jack Warner? Any help appreciated Thanks Dave	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League_of_Gentlemen_(film)	The League of Gentlemen (film)
661	In this film someone searches for something via secret clues that are left in black and white newsreels from the 1930s (such as, I think, “Hop Picking in Kent”). Each of the newsreels ends with the name of the next newsreel to find. I am not sure whether the protagonist ever finds what they want. It gets hectic and confusing… I remember one scene: the archive where they look for the film is an old underground government bunker situated in the middle of London, near Hyde Park.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_City_(film)	Hidden City (film)
983	The film I recall I saw late-night on TV in the early 80s.  Set in World War Two, I recall the TV magazine gave the date it was made as 1970 or ’71, maybe ’72.  The opening scene has a man in military uniform with a black beard at somewhere like a military camp, possibly as a prisoner.  He has flashbacks to some sort of brutal scenes.  The flashbacks show as split-second images, interspersed with images of him staring into space as he sits alone in a room.  In one of them, we glimpse a woman with a blood on her being manhandled.  In another flashback, we see someone-perhaps the woman-being violently punched in the face.  If I recall rightly, the man wants revenge for what he recalls. I think the film was British or maybe European with a British lead actor, not American.  Does it sound familiar?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_(1970_film)	Underground (1970 film)
294	This movie haunts me. In the movie, there is a brother and sister that live in a trailer. The brother is very bad and it is revealed later that he raped his sister. At some point he forces her to be the get away driver for him after he robs a bank. The sister is saved by a friend of the brother and the brother ends up being shot in a shoot out between him and the police at his trailer. Random details that I remember: -a wanted poster goes up and the sister ends up cutting her long hair short -the guy the saves her, I think, was trying to buy a car from her brother Thanks for any input!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.T.W._(film)	F.T.W.

192	I watched this on TV in the eighties.  American actors.  The plot involved a quack/ scam artist doctor selling fake cures for leukemia.  He somehow gets an ancient ring from Africa (Egypt?) which is jabbed into the victims neck to get blood.  Somehow the blood acquired this way made the person youthful.  The doctors wife or girlfriend used the ring.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leech_Woman	The Leech Woman
890	So I saw this movie probably around 1979. It was a B & W movie set in the 1920’s Gangster era as can be told by the clothing and the cars. It starts out with this young high school couple at a party and the male is getting very drunk, they both leave the party and he’s driving (no shocker there, they can’t crash unless he drives). You guessed it, they crash coming around a corner into a tree. I can’t remember if they were found, but the girl ends up at this old farmhouse and being held hostage by a gangster (although she’s not tied up, she’s being well taken care of by the gangster, but she’s a prisoner none-the-less), I believe his name was Candy. I believe her boyfriend might have been there with her at first, but I’m not sure. He does come back for her, and thats really all I can remember.

377	I saw this movie sometime around 2004 (approximately) and have been trying to figure out what it is for years. I’m fuzzy on details, but this is what I remember: There was a murder or murder accusation, and the story was mainly about a husband and wife. It took place in a house near a dock. There is some kind of mystery and there is a scene involving a wooden box that was important–I think either a character found a key that unlocked a wooden box, or found a wooden box with a key inside? I believe I saw it on television. It was in English, in color. I’m not sure when it was made, but it was definitely not that old when I saw it. Does anyone know what this might be?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Lies_Beneath	What Lies Beneath
929	I remember this movie — probably in the 80s or 90s — and on VHS because I saw it multiple times. There was a boy trapped in a cage. The cage as suspended by a rope or a chain, and it as in an empty tower or column. It seems like there was another cage hanging slightly higher than his, and his friend-another boy-was captive in that one. I remember it with a magical/fantasy genre. It may be a different movie, or it may have a scene in the same movie with the two boys forced to battle each other. Thanks for any leads.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mio_in_the_Land_of_Faraway	Mio in the Land of Faraway
512	I saw this movie sometime around 2011-2014, someone borrowed it from a Redbox, so I would think the movie came out sometime around then. It is set in a fantasy medieval-ish kingdom. Starts of with a man being a guard, or something similar, to a king and somehow a king became a tyrant (or the king died and his son became the tyrant king?). Some people were killed (tried to run and were killed?) including this man’s family. I think this happened during the winter (unless the kingdom was always cold.) Man pretends to be a drunkard who has lost hope and goes home with a prostitute every night, but really isn’t a drunkard and pays the prostitute without actually spending any time with her and goes home, as he is only putting on an act so the king’s men will think he has given up and is not plotting revenge (but he is).  This man along with some other guys are all in on a plan to overthrow the king. Their job is to make shields and somehow use the rivets in the shield (they looked like viking shields with the rivets around the edges, if I remember correctly) as part of their plan, or messaging system to plan the plan. Something of that sort. At some point a man on the inside, as they say, has a daughter that is going to be forced to marry the king, but they smuggle the main character guy inside the castle in an ornate mirror so that he can rescue their inside man’s daughter. I’m quite sure near the end, or at the end of the movie, the group battle the king’s men outside the castle, defeats them, and it show’s the main guy ready to go into the castle to kill the king. I apologize for all the parentheses and run-on sentences, I typed it up as my brain remembered things.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Knights	Last Knights

768	there was this movie I watched when I was younger… -+ 10 years ago. it was an American movie about soldiers fighting humanlike robots (on an island I don’t know). I remember a scene where 1 guy got impaled by a wooden spear and the pain was too excruciating he ended up shooting himself. and this one scene where the last two survivors (man and woman) were kissing and all of a sudden they both got impaled by a wooden spear killing the dude but the woman survived due to the fact that she was hit in the shoulder. she successfully defeated the killerrobot and towards the end she fought this giant robot and ended up destroying it….

572	So, there’s this movie. I’ve seen it around 2006 ( i know cause I watched it alongside Hard Candy). The thing is I can’t find it no matter what. I’m starting to wonder if I dreamt it??? So the film is in English, not sure which country is made of. It’s about an experiment. This guy replies to an add for some experiment in the mountains, paid tester or whatever. In a pub prior to the climb to the mountain he meets this girl * but she’s not really important to the story anyhow* So on the mountain he meets the doctor…. then not sure what happens.. but basically the guy has turned him immortal, and keeps killing him over and over again… In the end, surprise twist, when our hero tries to kill the doctor, he discovers that he is immortal too, hence he was the patient 0 or patient 1. a patient before him… He escapes somehow I think…   Anyone? What’s the title of this film? Or films that sounds something like it?   Thanks	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Two	Subject Two
1032	i cannot for the life of me remember this movie title. I just remember one of the main characters is this really trashy woman who claims the universe won’t let her die. The villains get this scrawny black guy to hack into a security system or something and she shows up in this crappy car and starts screaming at them while running towards them with a machete. She kills the bodyguard and then tries to kill the black guy but he explains he is not the main character. The exchange was “IM NOT _____!” “Oh! Then why were you running?” “Because you had a KNIFE!!!” And she just can’t die or have bad luck or something. Like when people try to shoot her the bullets always miss and she’s trying to kill the main character for some reason.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently%27s_Holistic_Detective_Agency_(TV_series)	Dirk Gently%27s Holistic Detective Agency (TV series)
881	Hey everyone, this is my first time posting here so I hope I do things right here.   So a few years ago I saw a thriller on tv about a father, whos kid was kidnapped. The dad had his suspicions on a certain guy, but the police couldn’t really find anything on him. But the father was so sure it was the guy, he ended up kidnapping him, trapping him inside of a rundown building and eventually even torturing him. The last info is a spoiler for the movie so heads up: In the end (I think) it turned out to have been the mother of the guy the dad kidnapped and whom he had visited to question on her son multiple times.   End Spoiler   I honestly don’t remember any actors from the movie but I am fairly certain it’s an american movie that is probably not older than say 15 years?   Alright thanks to any answers in advance.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_(2013_film)	Prisoners (2013 film)
138	Okay, so, I remember watching this movie on a tape cassete (I think you call them VHS?). Cartoon. I’m rpetty sure it begins with a giant walkignt hrough a street at night, with a suitcase. He might have been doing something with stardust? I think he’s an alchemist or magician. He kidnaps a boy, or the boy falls into his suitcase somehow. The boy had red hair and round glasses (I think). The movie then carries on in the Giants cave. I’m not sure about what else happens. I saw this three or four times in several places, maybe around 2006-2007 (I could be wrong).	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BFG_(1989_film)	The BFG (1989 film)
896	I first saw this in the 90s so specific details beyond this scene are beyond me.  I’m pretty sure the movie was made in the 60s or 70s.  It has mild nudity (just breasts I believe) which makes me think early 70s but it definitely felt 60s at the time.  The main actor reminds me (several years on now) of Cary Grant or a young Michael Caine but I don’t see anything in their IMDB that fits the scene I remember. The movie is about a cat burglar (main character) who gets into some trouble and has to either prove his innocence or do a job for someone else, pretty standard fare.  Not sure of the main plot beyond that.  What I do remember is that the movie somewhat starts off with him pilfering the apartment or hotel room of a wealthy older lady who is in the bath at the time while her husband is still downstairs entertaining.  I believe she catches him and won’t let him go until she’s had her fun (I’m not 100% sure about that).  Eventually he does make it out of there and back to his (or his lover’s) place.  She’s fairly young and a dancer so when she arrives complaining of aching feet, he rubs them for awhile before the two turn it up.  Either she complains about him needing to retire or doesn’t know anything about it, I’m leaning towards the latter. I can say it’s not Gambit or To Catch a Thief as neither has that scene.  Ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassiter_(film)	Lassiter (film)
535	I remember watching a movie in the late 80’s about one or more aliens that infected humans. The casualties begin acting stressed, then their eys turn black and then the alien rips out of their bodies. I remember two somewhat more specific occasions. One is a teacher / scientist that starts stressfully writing on the schoolboard, then crouches and the alien rips out of his back, long black nails first. Second is one where the nails come out of the victims face. I believe the movies starts with a girl jogging in a dark setting, some streetlights and may be foggy. Then the view point changes to something chasing her. Im not sure if what happens next is shown, but an important part in the first few scenes of the movie i also remember is a crime-scene with the two main characters: A woman, seemingly not from earth, covering a big out of space like big gun under a trenchcoat, and a man, probably police officer or FBI who sees that woman and knows something is fishy. The woman is there to catch / kill / recapture the alien. The guy helps her throughout the movie. There are several chasing scenes where people try to get away before being infected by the parasite like alien. I remember a scene that points out that coffee is something the woman has never had. And late in the movie I remember that a creature is captured inside a sealed room in spaceship / station. Not sure if its “the mother” and if it escapes. There is a scene where a heavy door that should be closed opens up. I’ve been trying to find this movie for almost 25 years, still remembering all these details. Never found it. Friends say it must be the famous Alien movie, but i don’t think so. I watched it when i was ~9 years old, with my 6 years older nephew. He told me back then that the movie was called Monsters, but that was probably loosely translated. It could well be that my memory is not completely accurate, but most of what i described i can clearly visualize. Would be great if someone recognizes this movie!

246	1950s B/W about the suburbs. Several neighbor families in a new suburb.  The families are all white but from different socioeconomic classes, professionals, tradesmen, white-collar workers all living in harmony. Not all of them have children. One of the men, played by someone who looks a bit like Charles Bronson, is angry. The plot hinges on this. The conflict ends as he is on his carport working under his car when the jack slips and he is crushed under the wheel. His wife and kid presumably move away, much happier now that their angry husband/father is gone, but also with trepidation because in spite of it all, they loved him and he was the breadwinner.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Down_Payment	No Down Payment

He mustve had several dozen of cops right behind him at one point and when it looked like he was about to get caught a trucker showed up in a far distans, shortly after several others showed up behind it and they spread out in a line. Im not sure but I think he was driving an american muscle car, it was for sure an american movie, colored, and if I had to guess maybe from the 80’s or 90’s.

612	Hi, Its been several years now since I’ve been trying to recall the movie name. I believe I saw it around 2010 and the movie release should be around that date also give or take a couple years. It is definitely a romance movie involving two people who pretends to be rich and ends up falling in love. I remember one scene they go into a fancy restaurant and the guy asks her how are they going to pay for the meal towards the end of the dinner. She says not to worry and pulls out aluminum foil (I believe) from her purse and puts it in her mouth or food.. then telling the waiter that there is garbage in their food and they do not want to cause a scene so they will just get up and leave. The couple eventually breaks up.  Towards the end of the movie ( my friend thinks I’m mixing the ending with a different movie but I believe they are the same movie) the guy gets a job as a delivery man? Not sure if he was delivering a package or a letter but it was to a rich guy with a big house and he sees the girl that was with him earlier in the house and realizes that she married a rich guy.

1092	Here is a question on the animated TV-series aired on Saturdays in the early 80s. I’m sure these cartoons were aired before the summer of 1983, thus the release date could be no later then 1983. I’ve attempted to find these on Saturday Morning TV Schedules of the 80s, but no luck whatsoever. Thought it might be ‘The Littles’, but the description and the outlines do not match. Also, ‘The Littles’ were released a little bit later. The plot is somewhat the following: A family moves into a new country house and at some point children discover that certain tiny little people (resembling elves or gnomes) are living next to them in the garden (or perhaps under the house). As I recall, each episode was a single story, however there was this general intrigue with some ‘snake people’ being mentioned repeatedly. The ‘gnomes’ believed ‘snake people’ to be their main frightful enemies. At the end of the series (or the first season) children and ‘gnomes’ explore a network of underground caves, resembling the snakes’ opened mouths, and discover an old comic book about snake people. So it turns out that no snake people exist.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_World_of_Og	The Secret World of Og
739	Saw this in 1974 at the pictures. It was a six part children’s serial, probably British, that played before the main movie each week. It was black & white, and featured a teenage boy & teenage girl. She had a pageboy hairstyle with black hair. As a ten year old I thought the girl was absolutely gorgeous! They were on a camel train with adults heading towards the pyramids. There was intrigue of some sort. I never got to see the next episode. Does this strike a chord with anyone?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings_(film)	Valley of the Kings (film)
766	Ok I have no clue what this movie is called but I do know it came out in the late 90’s early 2000’s. It is about a young monkey(capuchin) who is told to never leave the tree tops. The monkey’s are human like in that they talk, wear clothes, and have romantic relationships( or so the preview I saw made it seem this way). Anyways the protagonist does in fact go below the trees, I think he falls or gets pushed, and that is all I really know. I know it’s not disney or any major studios like pixar, universal or the like. I want to say it may have been an early anime but again I am not sure. If some one can help me I would greatly appreciate it I have wanted to see this movie for a long time but I can never find the name and so can not buy it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Monkey's_Tale	A Monkey's Tale
113	I watched this movie about ten years ago, but I’m pretty sure it was filmed before then.  It was something the teacher put on for us during a free day in elementary school.  The movie is based in France, somewhere in the countryside, but it is in English.  All I remember is that there’s a guy and a girl and one of them has two chimpanzees living with them and the other one is American.  I think they fall in love, but the chimps were a pretty significant part of the movie.  The only scene I remember clearly is the guy is walking down a dirt road, holding the chimpanzees’ hands.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeys,_Go_Home!	Monkeys, Go Home!

618	It’s a rather strange movie description so bear with me here! I definitely can’t remember the title or any of the names of the characters/actors seeing as I watched it with english subtitles about 4 or 5 years ago. I even watched it online so it’s impossible for me to track down… Anyway, it was definitely a Chinese film taking place in a more historical setting with emperors, generals, war, you know the ususal. The story focused on the relationship between two men. I believe one of the men was of a higher/royal power and the other had some kind of position in their army ??? I’m not quite sure. Either way, they were lovers. At some point everyone kept nagging the higher power (let’s just call him the king) to have an heir, but he was repulsed by sleeping with a woman. So, for some reason he told his lover to sleep with his wife so that she can become pregnant. The lover goes through with it and some time afterwards realizes that he actually enjoyed being with the opposite sex. It gets a bit fuzzy from there, but I do remember the wife and the king’s lover are caught “in the act” inside a storage room or something. The king is so offended that he throws him in prison or castrates him; something like that. I just remember the ending scene being of the two lovers riding on horses in a grass field… Apparently there was a painting they both admired that had the same scene. Another scene i vaguely remember are severed heads on spears place outside a castle ??? It was a very strange and dramatic film… If anyone by chance knows of or has seen this movie I’d greatly appreciate the title!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Frozen_Flower	A Frozen Flower
221	ok this is a bit of stretch, I dont remember much, here goes. Me and my sister used to have this really old mostly degraded VHS tape (of which the first few minutes were the only watchable parts, the rest of it was static) it was a home recorded tape so I wouldnt be able to recall anything about the box for clues. It starts out showing a star in the night sky and panning down to see some elves marchng through the snow and singing a song, the next scene im sure carries on in santa’s workshop but the tape we had was so badly damaged everything was speed up and nothing more of the film survived, me and my sister would watch it just because we found it so funny (before my parents had enough and distroyed it). Im sure it was live action (or at least with pupets? I was so small my memory might not be the most trustworthy), its not any of the santa claus movies either, if anyone has any suggestions?

440	Hi. I saw this movie many years ago in TV. It was a classic one, maybe 50s or 60s at most. It was about 3 or 4 people, maybe sailors, who are splitting after ending their service, and are in a bar. They somehow decide to meet again 20 or 25 years later, and write a letter to themselves they put somewhere in the bar. Then the movie jumps to years later, when they actually get back, each one expecting to be the only one to show up for the meeting, and tell themselves of their lives. Anyone remembers it?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Always_Fair_Weather	It%27s Always Fair Weather
1065	I remember details about this movie I saw on cable about a decade ago, but of course not the title, and of course none of the actors’ names. I hope someone knows something because it’s been killing me. Vaguely, I remember that it’s about a group of college graduate friends who are reuniting at one of the friend’s house. I think I remember the college they attended is Yale, and that the girl who owns the house married or is girlfriends with a local and at some point someone refers to him as a “townie”, so that might indicate the film takes place in New Haven? Probably. Also, one of the friends is a gay and I remember two scenes with him where he was reading something (I think it was some sort of erotica) and another friend grabs the book from him and reads aloud as to  make fun of him. There’s also another scene with the gay dude where he kisses one of the other friends, a straight dude. I remember the straight dude was handsome, and it was obvious the gay dude had a crush on him from way back in college — this scene happens outside the house, at night, I think. I remember scenes between the host who is one of them and her husband, the “townie” that are very where they argue among other things how her friends look down on him, and I believe at some point they have makeup sex because they’re going through a rough patch in general but I don’t remember the specifics of that situation. From what I remember the end of the movie is the reunion being over and everyone is packed and leaving the house/guests. I believe this film is from either the 80’s or 90’s. I know this is vague but I would appreciate any clues you might have or even the title. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_and_a_Match	Seven and a Match
882	It was a light comedy from the 80s or 90s. I just remember the start of the movie. It was a scene with two adventures in a scene like indiana jones, trapped, captured by enemy forces. The main villain was approaching them and one commented to the other: “And now he comes and says something very cliche like ‘gentlemen, we meet again’, wanna see?”  So the villain really says that, and they find it funny.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewalker_(film)	Firewalker (film)
757	A girl is kidnapped. Her somewhat senile grandfather writes to various “adventurers” from books like “Mack Bolan” and “The Executioner” thinking them to be real. Surprisingly, one responds and comes to search for the girl; consisting of the rugged adventurer and his partner who will later write a book on the adventure. The girl’s sister goes along on the search. Comedy ensues. Think this was back in the 90s. I thought it was Bill Pullman but nothing like this is listed in his credentials.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Speed	Jake Speed
654	I’m picturing a scene and it’s driving me insane that I can’t figure out where I saw it. I thought it was from one of the Ocean Trilogy movies, but I just fast forwarded through all 3 of them and didn’t see it. There’s a tiny chance I missed it but it’s more likely I have the wrong movie. The movie (or possibly TV show episode) is definitely in English and in color and came out between 1995 and 2015 (more likely before 2010). The scene I see has 2 con artists /criminals working together (I think there is actually a large group but this scene focuses on 2). They are in 2 separate lines at airport security. They both have fake passports/identities and they are dressed in character. There characters are very different – while perhaps incorrect, I am picturing Bernie Mac in traditional South African attire and Eddie Jemison as a Rabbi or something. They both get to the front of their security lines and realise they have switched passports so Bernie Mac has to pretend to be a rabbi in his South African attire and Eddie Jemison takes off his yamaka and pretends to be South African. The security agent with Eddie happens to speak the South African language and the crew of con artists get really nervous as they watch Eddie wondering how he’s going to convince the security agent. After a pause, Eddie responds perfectly in the South African language and suprises everyone. They both make it through the security line safely.   Again, I may have the actors and fake identities wrong, but the the concept is definitely correct, and hopefully some of my memory is correct and will spark something in one of your minds! I’ve spent HOURS today searching for this so I will be REALLY thankful to anyone who can help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team_(film)	The A-Team (film)
452	I’ve now spent 2 days trying to find a movie I saw over a year ago and I’m growing increasingly frustrated.  Here’s what I remember about it: It was partly a documentary, partly a fiction film.  Basically, the plot was about a bunch of friends from college (who started their own sketch comedy group) wanted to create a movie with several guidelines: the main one being that each person would write the next scene in a movie without knowing what comes before or after that point, but only keeping the same characters, etc.  Sort of like that game you play where each person tells the next part of the story.  At which point, the actual story would then be reenacted with actors.  I have no idea what this movie was called, but it came out around 2012-2014 and Google is ZERO help.  Please help me!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exquisite_Corpse_Project	The Exquisite Corpse Project
183	Okay so this movie was about a crazy (likefun crazy, not psycho) German man who was supposedly dead but he comes ancl to life or something?? This little girl with long hair is present when he comes back to life, and the German man KIDNAPS HER and takes her on whacky adventures looking for something. He has to find all of his weird friends with weird powers to save this girl’s town from bad people I guess? There’s one guy who yells super loud, one guys who’s strong af, another who can run fast, etc. Some of the adventures include going underwater for some reason, almost getting the German guy’s head chopped off in some Greek looking place, there’s some sort of moon adventure where German man turns into a horn dog and seduces the Moon Queen or something and the Moon King gets jealous and they have to flee. At the end, the German guy sacrifices himself to save this town and the townspeople finally realize he wasn’t just a crazy old man and stuff idk	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Baron_Munchausen	The Adventures of Baron Munchausen

461	“Creature” horror movie (e.g. like The Relic or Razorback) from the 80’s or 90’s, probably an adaptation from some Stephen King’S book or a similar author. What I remember from this movie is that the creature is something like a giant bat. In the final acts, they are inside something like a coal mine, and while chasing the main character, its tail gets stuck in a stone crusher machine. The main character turns on the machine and the creature gets crushed. As I mentioned in the title the movie felt much like an adaptation of a S.

298	So, twenty years ago I came across a film in our local video rental place.  The movie was a British or Irish comedy that had come out sometime in the mid to late 1990s.  It was about a meek librarian who lived with a domineering mother, had  a bitch of a sister with a thuggish boyfriend and a lover she had to hide from her family.  She was fascinated by great serial killers of the past and eventually several famous ones start appearing to her.  They help guide her in first killing her mother, then her sister and then the sister’s boyfriend.  She ends marrying her lover and sending her “advisors” away because – as she points out – they were all caught and she doen’t want to be. There are two scenes that I particular remember.  The first is after she kills her sister, which she does by doing something to her inhaler.  The sister’s boyfriend decides that she killed her because she wanted him.  They are standing in the kitchen together and he tells her that she can have him if she wants him that badly.  I remember her smiling at him and putting her arms around him before stabbing him in the back with a pair of scissors. The second is the last sense.  She’s on her honeymoon with the man she’s been in love with the entire time and they are lying in bed together.  He has his eyes closed, getting ready to go to sleep and he says that btw he knows she killed her mother.  Something she said at the time didn’t add up but that he understands why she did it and would never tell anyone.  She gets up out of bed after he’s asleep and is trying to figure out to what to do.  She opens the door and there’s a little man in a Victorian suit with a kind of doctor’s bag there who smiles at her and introduces himself very politely as Jack the Ripper.  She smiles back at him and that’s the end of the movie. It’s a very dark comedy but also a very cleaver one that I really enjoyed.  I’d really love to find it again.  There are aspects to the movie that remind me a little of ‘Keeping Mum’ if you know that movie.  However, while the acting in the film is brilliant I don’t remember seeing any of the actors in it before or since. Help?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Advice	Deadly Advice
191	I saw a trailer for this film and haven’t been able to get it out of my head.  A teenage boy (blonde, curly hair) moves in with his female friend’s family. I think the family was Hispanic.  The family seems nice and welcoming at first but they’re actually horrible people.  I recall the father or uncle slapping someone in the movie trailer.  I think the boy and girl are both prostituted and/or raped.  The premise was that the boy did not lose hope or faith in humanity despite all the abuse he was being subjected to.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Bad_Can_Happen	Nothing Bad Can Happen

Also, one of the main “bad guys” kept telling people to “Sleep” like they were some kind of powerful being.

1024	Hello all! I remember when I was a kid, I was watching late afternoon (…) horror films on cable TV (yes, they did that). I clearly remembered two cult films. After extensive search I found the first, it was Black Roses (awesome b-movie). The second one, I can’t find no matter what search I make on google. It’s a story of a murderer or serial killer who is incarcerated possibly in an insane asylum. But “satan” grants him the ability to move through walls and escape every night to keep killing. The only one who finds out is the warden’s daughter. Then, with the help of a biker(?) they try to stop the killer, until the biker commits suicide (by driving his motorbike under a truck?) to become a ghost and defeat the killer. In the end, the warden’s daughter stands near a payphone, the phone rings and “satan” laughs as the warden comes and puts her in a straitjacket, which apparently is her punishment for soiling the devil’s plan. What a great flick! Anyone know the title?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/976-Evil_II	976-Evil II
647	I watched this movie on TV about 10 years ago, it had a 90’s feel to it and i’m pretty sure it was American, could be wrong though. All i can remember is one scene, where a guy who i think was actually the devil or some sort of demon (but looked normal and human, in a suit etc) was trying to seduce a woman. The walls started crawling/twisting and i think her skin started to crawl too, almost like she was hallucinating, i think faces started to appear in walls etc. It was definitely a psychological film, i can’t remember if it was particularly horror like or not. I think as the film goes on it becomes apparent who he is/she finds out who he is during this scene.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Advocate_(1997_film)	The Devil%27s Advocate (1997 film)

755	I saw once a movie, about 1 year ago maybe, I think it isn’t that old… It was about a man, that hit his head somehow, and then started dreaming. But you only knew that at the end of the movie, the start of the movie is normal, with him and his wife and children in the house. It was winter if I remember correctly, the man reminds me of nicolas cage don’t know why, his wife is a blonde girl, her real name is sounds something like polish/czech, and they had kids, or 1 girl, can’t remember exactly. He was living his life like that until some cop break into the house and finds him afterwards, he sees that he is dreaming and stuff like that, and the wife and the girl dissappears and there ends the movie. This movie left me in tears and gave me some kind of feeling that I never felt before. If someone, anyone knows something let me know please! Would be very appreciated!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_House_(2011_film)	Dream House (2011 film)
347	I remember seeing a movie some time in the 90’s – I think it was from early 90’s maybe later 80’s. It was in color, English, probably made for tv… A high  school age girl starts hanging with the wrong crowd and gets in some trouble. Her parents send her to a horse farm to work there hoping it’ll change her attitude. I think there are other wayward teens there as well. The farm is run by a woman who is, I think, a single mother. She acts as a mentor to the girl. At first, the girl resists, but eventually lightens up and starts to do well at the farm. She bonds with a horse and she’s happy and all is well. Then tragedy strikes. She gets into an accident (I want to say she falls off the horse) and she winds up in a coma in the hospital. Eventually she comes out of it, but she’s paralyzed. They bring her to the farm to see the horse in a wheelchair, but she’s mad and she blames the horse. In the end she magically gets up and walks again, forgives the horse, and is normal again. I think it was a pretty cheesy movie, but I was just thinking about it and wondered if anyone knew what it was. I did a google search, but I couldn’t find it. I remember the dad being someone that was kind of well known. Thanks, Shawn	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Horse_%281992_film%29	Dark Horse %281992 film%29
609	So over thanksgiving break in 2013 I was at my roommate’s house and we watched this movie and I don’t really remember much from it but it was with this guy and I feel like he had to go back in time? But I’m not too sure and he had to get something like a briefcase or he had to break into a vault or something of that sort to get secret information but it turns out the government was really bad and they wanted to end the world or something? Or explode a bomb or something bad and the guy realized it but the government already got what they needed and at the end the guy is hanging off a ledge with the bad guy and he drops the bad guy off while managing to hold himself up. This is the most I remember and I remember loving it. I wish I knew who the guy in it was because that would help big time	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_(film)	Paycheck (film)
707	Google has failed me… Year – late 80s My grandparents were watching some movie or tv show after they thought I was asleep for the night. I must have stood in the hallway for a long time watching without them realizing. My grandparents were fairly “proper” people, so I expected this to be an episode of Masterpiece Mystery or Poirot, but I can’t find it. Anyway… In English, possibly black and white, maybe only black and white to signify flashback? An adult male – maybe priest? – drowns a young boy in a bathtub. The bathroom is not modern. Rough wood plank floors and a tub with feet. The scene involves watch sloshing over the edge of the tub. During the drowning, a necklace or rosary gets washed down the drain. I don’t know if this was a flashback or what but the next piece I remember is years later, somehow people find the necklace/rosary in the septic tank. Maybe the building burned down? Not sure.

1072	Daughter of immigrant mother starts selling drugs after leaving school. It’s about a 16 year old girl, brunette, with a boy look. The film was relesaed after 2013 and it was not in English, I think it was French or Dutch. She has a girl best friend, black and corpulent, who I think is Muslim and later dies in a fire. In the first scenes the protagonist appears doing a kind of dramatization as a secretary and since she doesn’t like what she is doing, star to humiliates her teacher. The girl gets upset and starts to grab her things to leave and never come back to class anymore. She starts selling drugs because of a neighbor she admires. She is delighted with her job as a drugdealer because she starts to obtain benefits, such as food, cellphone and other things that due to her economic situation she could not obtain before because her mom is a prostitute. The woman who is her employer orders her to go to a party to seduce a man and then steal his money that he had hidden in the apartment. The girl and her friend secretly watched the dancers in a theater, they also hid the money they earned from drugs there. One day the dancer discovers the protagonist and takes away the money. They fall in love, bla, bla. In the end, he tells her to leave together from that place but she doesn’t do it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divines_(film)	Divines (film)
492	so there’s this movie about this guy and his baby in a city, there’s a gang of children who are turned into monsters because of a drug they use. They can only see you if you fear them.

588	Hi I remember a movie it had to be an ifc film i seen about 4 years ago It was a little girl and her father in a big house in the desert or Texas the little girl was in a dirty white dress most of the movie and I think she played in a train car box and her father kept saying he was going scuba diving when he would “shoot heroin” do drugs and I think they had the dead body of her mother or grandmother in the house…..strange film that me and the other person remember watching but can’t figure out what it was.please help!!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tideland_(film)	Tideland (film)
598	I remember seeing a car chase movie at the drive-in back in the early ’70’s as a teen, and I cannot remember the name of the movie. One of the scenes that sticks out in my mind was when the driver of the car being chased by cops ducks into a local Earl Scheib and has the car painted in like 30 minutes, then gets away only to be chased again when the cops figure out that he has had the car painted.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha,_Bobby_and_Rose	Aloha, Bobby and Rose
656	I believe this came on as a Saturday morning movie, like the ABC Weekend Specials in the early 80’s. It begins in the early 1900’s with a young girl running from bad guys in a tunnel. She falls and hurts herself and ends up dying. Decades later, the house that is above the tunnel is believed to be haunted. Two kids end up finding the tunnel behind the fireplace, find the girl’s skeleton and the locket she was wearing, and the girl’s death is finally explained. This is not The Haunted Mystery Mansion or Child of Glass.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Mansion_(1983_film)	Mystery Mansion (1983 film)
285	Basics: American movie, in English, color, was on HBO in the early-mid 80s It was a thriller / suspense type movie. There was a guy holding hostages in a large white mansion. He negotiated with police who provided him with a means of escape (helicopter or boat?); however, the snipers were ready for him. When he made his getaway, he surrounded himself with hostages and covered the whole group with a large bed sheet as he crossed a huge green lawn outwitting the cops. I was unable to finish the movie, and I have been unable to remember the title for over 30 years. Please help!! I wish that I could remember more, but I was too young. Thanks all !!  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_to_Kill_(1988_film)	Shoot to Kill (1988 film)
299	In the early 90’s I saw on late-night cable an adult-theme animated movie that I’ve never been able to find a reference for ever again. It was a very well-done animation (not cartoony), mostly noticeable in the coloring that was not flashy or brilliant as most cartoons are. It appeared to be setup in a post-apocalyptic or prehistoric world. Lots of rocks, very limited technology. The main character was a woman that – if my very limited memory serves me right – was in a quest of sorts. I believe it ended with her flying off in a pterodactyl. The movie had some hot parts, not straight-out porn if I recall correctly, but soft-erotica at least.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Metal_(film)	Heavy Metal (film)
159	Edo Period set colour Japanese film from late 50’s early 60’s opening with four travellers (two women, two men) on their way to Edo; as one of the women seems rather delicate they rest while the men go to nearby waterfall – one slays the other.  Survivor returns, tells the women he was attacked and rest of the movie further demonstrates the evil, duplicitous nature of the man culminating with widow’s revenge. Aired on TCM 6-8 months ago when screening influential, Japanese directors.  My recollection is the title is one word and not being Kurosawa but another great of the mid-century.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokaido_Yotsuya_kaidan	Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan
865	So there’s this movie which came out within the last 5 years. It’s a horror movie. A bunch of men are being tortured by someone who is holding their wives/girlfriends hostage. As long as the man endures his torture his ladylove will not be harmed. However the men are told that they will never be allowed to leave. Now the following details may not be accurate… The director was a person of colour, I think. The movie was Australian. The director had some bit roles in other movies and this was his first directorial venture. It wasn’t a mainstream movie.

1096	The movie was made between the dates 2000-2010 for sure. It was in english, in color, and definetly a movie not a tv episode. I specifically remember a scene where a girl  seemed to be kidnapped in a car by a bunch of weird people. The people were all freaks with things wrong with them. One guy had worms coming from his face and another had something to do with play cards. He could like throw them and use them as like ninja stars. I believe she liked one of the guys? Pleassse help. Thanks so much.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_They_Come_Back..._Again	Sometimes They Come Back... Again
714	I dont remember most of this scene in this movie. I watch this movie about 2004-2005. the movie is about 3 men whose lost their money and they were suspecting a group of women. So, in order to investigate the women, they disguise themselve as woman and make excuse to live with the women. The scene that remember the most is where a man taking bath at night and suddenly a woman joined him. But the girl didnt realizes that the man is a man caused she didnt wear her glasses. And in the movie, the men fall in love with the group of women they live with. [SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES LATER:–ed.] I watch this movie in 2004-2006, There were 3 men(if im not mistaken). They lost their money and they suspecting a group of ladies. Hence they disguise as ladies in order to investigate them. I dont realy remember all the scene. But there is a scene when the man take bath and suddenly a lady enter the bathroom and take bath together. The lady is not wearing her glass so she didnt find out that she was taking bath with the man. Then somewhere in the movie the men fall in love the ladies	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorority_Boys	Sorority Boys
1073	This was an episode of a TV show made in the 1990s. It was in color and in English. The episode in question involves this guy coming to a town where people get agitated whenever anything “musical”, such as whistling, tapping a glass with a fork, etc. I only remember two scenes vividly. The first depicted a young girl blowing her head off with a shotgun in a cemetery. The other scene was of the main character and the townsfolk singing “Amazing Grace”, causing a spectral monster to appear and kill everybody.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Visions_(TV_series)	Night Visions (TV series)
706	I watched this movie on Israel Channel 2, sometime around 1995. It was not in English language (maybe dubbed). Seeing all the nudity and off-screen sex scenes, it was definitely not a US film. Film starts with a glasses wearing scrawny looking guy who visits a friend or someone he knows. The latter was always wearing nothing but a robe and panties. Had a huge collection of nude catalogues and sex position materials. He was probably a man that gets paid to have sex with women. Soon, he gets picked by ambulance and hands over his panties to the first guy. Fun starts here: I do not know how, but he runs into a (homeless?) girl. She moved in. Seduces him. One scene in particular she spat milk over her own body. Milk flowed down and she opened her robe to reveal she was waearing nothing (breasts & nipples). Man started licking milk off her body. Next scene they are both inside shower behind frosted glass. They had many sex encounters. Then got into an argument where she left/or got thrown out. Few days later she comes back as she had no where else to go I think. He let her in, yet keep on humiliating her by having fun with other girls when she is around and force her to serve as a maid. Near the end the man tricks her by leaving his seat inside the airplane and let her fly alone.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_Moon	Bitter Moon
522	Okay so watched this movie, probably in the 2012 or around that time. It was in english. The story was about a woman who has escape from something and she has taken a bus, she’s changed her looks; short chestnut hair, glasses etc. She shifts to a beach side settlement, where she goes to a grocery and she meets a small kid(I’m not sure is it was a girl or boy), then she meets the kids father. She rents a wooden cottage near the woods and she plans to paint it. She has a bicycle. She goes to the grocery to buy paint and she meets the kids father again. They become good friends (the guy is almost her age). He helps he paint her cottage and the floorboards break and they paint it pale yellow. They both fall in love with each other. And she frequently visits them and they all go on picnins and all. They show that she is very discreet about her past and they show a man looking for her and he tracks her down to the beach side settlement. After that I do not remember. I really want to watch that movie again, but I don’t seem to recollect the name. So if you guys know any similar movie please let me know ? ? thank you	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Haven_(film)	Safe Haven (film)
515	Hello! I watched this movie on NEtflix or something, full colour, can´t remeber the language. The Plot is a guy who watched a car accident with his family in a highway. He falls in love with the woman from one of the car of the accident after he visited her at the hospital. Then he got problems with his wife and keep seening the coma girl, eventually she wakes up and she and her family thinks he is some boyfriend she got from her holidays a few time ago, in some tropical place (a drug dealer or something) and hes invited to have dinner and stuff. Finally the real boyfriend aperaed at the final scene, in a cabin near some lake or sea and they try to kill each other.

858	I think it may be contemporary to “Let the right in” (the 2008 original Sweedish one, not the USA remake), and probably is Scandinavian as well, though it could be German. Anyway, I’m pretty sure it’s from Europe. I can only remember that there was some sort of hidden, parallel apartment. Someone starts hearing some noises (someone crying, or having sex) from the neighbours, and discovers hidden corridors and rooms. Doors and walls are broken to discover new spaces. The tone of the movie is dark, misterious. It’s a thriller, with some horror elements as well. The title could have some of this words: “hidden”, “next door” or “neighbour”. I’ve forgot almost everything about it, but I know I enjoyed it very much.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naboer	Naboer
576	I watched this on tv sometime in the nineties. It was in English and in color. I was very young so I only remember two scenes: – montage of the two sisters growing up. They’re always in competition. They each bake a cake and when the good sister’s cake comes out perfectly, the evil sister casts magic to make it flop. – the good sister is grown up and walking through the desert. She encounters an African woman with a water flask who offers her a single drop of water. She lets it fall onto her tongue. It’s one of those movies with knights and kings and women in long dresses. Maybe with a dragon somewhere even? It definitely featured magic. Please help it’s driving me crazy!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dragon_Ring	The Dragon Ring
453	This is going to be long but I’m trying to add as much detail as possible. So I am looking for this fantasy movie, or maybe a series that was in 2 or 3 parts but more than an hour long? It is pretty old, I would say around the 90s, defo no more than 2005. The main character is an ordinary girl/woman I guess who somehow ends up in some world sort of like the “once upon a time” series. I don’t know if she is in some sort of mission to find something, all I know is that she is hunted and she has a partner with her helping her out of all this. One scene, she was running after some creature I think in a forest and he hides behind an ordinary tree. She goes behind that tree to not find him anymore. Then her and her partner finds an entrance on that tree, might be some hole on top of the tree or something. They walk in it to find that the tree is nothing like the rest, it is actually a home (much like the small tents in Harry Potter and the goblet of fire, once you go in it is like a huge marquee). Second scene I remember is of the girl taking shelter in that tree and when she wakes up she finds her hair has grown like crazy, like Rapunzel. She tries to carry her hair out but it becomes difficult for her to run around so she’s having to chop it all off like near her ear length?? She was angry about it I’m pretty sure because it wasn’t supposed to be cut this much. Before going out I think once she had to let her hair out of the window of the tree I think for her partner in crime to climb up and it was hurting her of course while he was climbing up. By the way, she’s blonde.   The final scene I remember is some sheep race. They end up at some weird village which celebrates sheep, they literally dress the sheep and have a parade. Somehow some challenge takes place that the sheep of one of the best girl of the village and the sheep of the main character (the girl) will have to do some race and some pageant thing of which sheep is best dressed or something. The night before the competition the village girl goes to a barn where some guy opens up the floor that has lights coming out of it and puts in her sheep to then drag it back out magically dressed well and powerful? The main girl mentions it to her partner and on the day he tries to do the same for her. During he race the village girl already got her sheep to run and the main girl is whistling and waiting for hers to come and at the last minute it comes. Somehow she wins the competition because her sheep was the better looking one. Sorry for the very long essay. I hope the details rings a bell to anyone reading this. Thank you.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10th_Kingdom	The 10th Kingdom
244	I saw this movie sometime in the mid to late 90s – early 2000s.  I remember a girl in a diner who goes into a back room and somehow gets transported to a magical land.  The parts I remember are spread out.  One part that really sticks out is that she is traveling with some people through the forest and then find themselves at an old ladys house.  She might have been a gypsy.  Outside her house there are all these birds in cages.  The girl feels bad for the birds so she lets a bird go free.  The gypsy lady gets mad and puts a curse on the girl.   The curse was that her hair would keep growing and growing.  Soon after this girls hair gets ridiculously long, like past her feet.  I think she is traveling with a young man and they fall in love.  Another part I remember is a man turning into a dog from a curse or spell a witch put on him.  The dog I think is trying to find the girl with the growing hair.  The witch needs this girl for some reason.  I remember at the end of the movie the girl ends up in this castle at a ball  and goes up to a room with a mirror.  She looks in the mirror and I think the witch shows up.  But that mirror gets her home somehow.  Does anyone know what I’m talking about?  Its in color, in English and I saw it on TV.  I thought it was ‘The 10th Kingdom’ but I didn’t see a scene in that movie with the growing hair.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10th_Kingdom	The 10th Kingdom
458	So the detail I have for this movie is limited, so I apologise. Also it’s a little all over the place. I remember the climax of the movie being like two grown men (possibly a Dad and a teacher – or they could’ve been next door neighbours) fighting in a school gym at night, and they end up on some kind of rock face/waterfall and someone falls, but no one dies! The following scene shows the family leaving the neighbourhood and the teacher/neighbour covered in plaster casts. I saw this movie on Sky Movies in the early 00s, I think I remember it being shown a lot. It was probably made in the late 90s. It was an American family movie. I’m pretty sure it started with the family moving into the neighbourhood with a pretty full car. And if I remember rightly, the Dad was quite a weighty/hefty dude. Sorry I haven’t included much detail but this is all I can remember! Hopefully the fight scene will ring some bells with somebody. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bully_(film)	Big Bully (film)
829	I saw the movie in the early 60’s on TV. It was in English. I think it was in black and white. If I remember right it was set at christmas time. There are about 5 children. When the parents die the oldest child takes the sibling around finding homes for them. I’m pretty sure trying to find homes for them all before christmas. I think there was snow. Earlier in the movie one of the children was afraid of something and said “I’m a feared , I’m a feared” i remember that because we used to say it all the time after watching this movie:)	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Mine_to_Give	All Mine to Give
1095	I remember seeing a trailer for a fantasy movie/general weird movie involving a guy who gets a job/works as something to do with this huge, fantastical machine (like a Sci-Fi, fantasy almost Terry Pratchett-Tardis like contraption.) , inside which there are a number of rooms, in-which all manner of random nonsense happens, including him meeting a very seductive woman (who is clearly evil).

This wizard guy steals a baby and his mother has to go find him and get him back through some crazy fantasy land. If she doesn’t get him back by a certain time, the baby has to stay there forever….the woman keeps getting tricked by the wizard but she eventually outsmarts him and gets her baby back.

406	Late 80’s or early 90’s, possibly French movie about a female who teleports to Earth from a more enlightened planet finds it strange. On the other planet they live free from want or need, only needing to run jump & play. You see them on a grassy hillside joyful and talking but for some reason they decide to send someone to Earth. Not all of them can teleport so easily, but one or two out of three of them make it there. They find it very odd. I don’t remember what the plot was. I remember her being psychic.

694	I remember a scene I caught on tv once (not sure if it was a tv show or a movie) where a man with glasses was confronted by a group of men (some sort of gang or hitmen) who were obviously there to fight him.  He did the whole “let me take my glasses off first” thing, but as he took them off he popped a lens out.  He then used it as a weapon against the attackers.  I cannot remember who won the fight.  It was an American movie or tv show in color.  Based on the quality of the picture, it looked like it could be from the late 80s or early 90s (think “Patriot Games” or “Witness” type of graininess)  but it may just be a poorer quality, more recent production.  I saw this on tv  around 4-5 years ago.  I’ve spent a lot of time trying to find out what it’s from lately, but I’ve come up empty handed.  Hopefully someone can help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Substitute_3:_Winner_Takes_All	The Substitute 3: Winner Takes All
224	I’m as certain as I can be this is not The Craft.  It’s about some (teenage) girls, learning witch craft as a way to gain power in school.  The scene I remember was all the girls having dinner together, and the course is snails.  One of the girls (I think she was the “put upon” girl) shows her total disgust at the thought of snails and slugs.  Cue meaningful looks from the other girls.  She goes back to her room, and finds one slug in her bed.  It disappears, so she relaxes.  She goes to bed and suddenly she’s covered in slugs and snails.  One goes inside her mouth and you see her biting down on it. This’ll be an easy one for you guys, I’m sure, but Googling just brings up “The Craft” and “Slugs”.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aenigma_(film)	Aenigma (film)
328	Last year in film school, I watched part of film about a boy who was given up for adoption (maybe forcibly?) to bad men in a foreign country. I believe to country was in Europe, possibly Italy. He grows up being forced to rape women who are held captive. The most shocking part of the film is when he finds out one of the women he raped is his mother. The film was released in the 1990s or early ’00s.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendies	Incendies

This same movie may also include a giant octopus attacking a bridge, but I couldn’t swear to it. Fairly certain that it was in color, but it was a LONG time ago. I saw it years ago (25+?) on one of those Saturday Afternoon Monster Movie Matinees. I think. Maybe. My sis and mom both remember the same thing, but have no idea where it came from.

557	I can’t for the life of me remember this film. I remember seeing it in the mid 2000s. It was a foreign film, I think either French or German, but I could be wrong. It centers around a young couple who break into the home of an aging revolutionary man, or couple, and analyzes why the old man left that life and idealism behind. I believe there was also a pool  in the house. It was definitely in color and was made recently (around 2000-2009). Thanks for the help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edukators	The Edukators
949	So it’s a foreign movie like cj7. There’s also this alien or creature a kid finds and it kinda grants wishes or something. One time the kid had swimming practice and the creature hopped on his back and made him really fast.   There’s another part I remember but idk if this is from cj7 or the movie I’m talking about. The kid asks for answers to the test so the creature gets the answers from another student but the name was also transferred so the teacher didnt accept it.   My description is so short. I watched with waaay back so I don’t remember much.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_the_Magic_Gourd_(2007_film)	The Secret of the Magic Gourd (2007 film)
152	Movie from  the early 2000s I believe about three people living in an apartment but never running into each other. One woman and two men are in the apartment. The woman is the realtor or owner of the apartment and at least one of the guys is a squator/homeless. It is a Korean or Chinese film I think. Art house flick… I think it won a few awards from film festivals like Cannes. Help if you can! ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vive_L%27Amour	Vive L%27Amour
850	I remember this movie where this teenage girl keep moving from foster home to foster home alot of times, at one point she was fighting with another girl then she threatened her with a knife to her throat then she cut her hair and her friend ( a boy) asked her why she chopped off her hair, while at another foster home she got shot and another the lady killed herself, at the end she lived with her friend, her mother was in prison.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Oleander_(film)	White Oleander (film)
254	I borrowed this film on VHS from the library in 2002-2003 when I was a teenager. I think it was from the 70s or 80s. I remember a middle aged woman being murdered (stabbed or shot) in an industrial/warehouse type apartment. Two french men (one is her husband maybe and the other is a detective) are trying to sold the murder, but keep making jokes and getting drunk? It keeps jumping all over the place, but couldn’t tell if it was intentionally done or just…french. One minute they are in a subway tunnel, then back in the apartment, seemingly forgetting all about the murder (maybe playing poker?) The ending has the two men and a young blond woman walking across a bridge and sitting in a field?  I also want to say the film name has something to do with “meat” or “butcher” .	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet_froid	Buffet froid
442	I have been looking for a year. No one knows. This site is one my last chances: I believe it to be a French movie. Between 1990 and 2005. Its about a teen boy and girl. Criminal they rob someone and flee the city. Get into the woods and get kidnapped. Girl is put in basement. Boy becomes a (sex) slave for the huge male hunter. Finally they escape but the boy seems to have developed affection for their kidnapper (stockholm syndrome). Police shooting in field at the end. Very sad psychological art drama.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Lovers	Criminal Lovers
1042	Hello, the movie I am looking for is, as far as I remember, a French movie / nouvelle vague / black & white. Probably 60s. The scene I remember is a boy running down a street at night with a cane in his hand, rattling it against a steel fence while running. I think you only see his feet and it was somehow a dream sequence. Finally he stops at a closed movie theater, he reaches with the cane through the closed steel gate and steals a movie poster. It might be Truffaut ? Anybody recognize this?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_for_Night_(film)	Day for Night (film)
931	Alright, so I last saw this movie as a kid around 1998, and I’m almost positive it was from the 90’s. I’m pretty sure it was distributed by Full Moon video because I remember there being commercials for Puppet Master toys (Which every kid wanted but no parent would allow) before the movie. I remember there was a group of kids going on a trip for some reason, a little boy and I think his older sister and her boyfriend. They stopped for gas at a creepy gas station, and the worker there was a Native American who warned them of the area up ahead, and to be sure not to make any promises to anyone! From there it’s a blur, but I remember everyone made it home safe at the end, and it was the little boys birthday. His parents bring him his cake and say something ending in “We Promise!” and I think his cake starts leaking green goo. And it just ends like that. PLEEEEASE, SOMEONE REMEMBER WHAT THIS IS CALLED!!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Town	Phantom Town
999	This has been bugging me for a while now, and I have asked and googled so many times! I’m pretty sure its a scene from a movie, which is sort of a classic rom com style film. Pretty sure it focuses around a couple that have gotten married (whether on purpose or not) and she’s a lot more into it than he his. The particular scene I remember, they are in some sort of counselling session, and the counsellor gives them these foam stick things, kind of like a pool noodle, and tells them to express their feelings with them. She starts to tap his face and his arms and such, and he is protesting and getting more and more annoyed and then finally flips out and just grabs it off her and tried to like break it on his knee. Its a really funny scene but I just can’t remember what its from!! Pretty sure she is blonde and wearing a white top, and he has brown hair. I really hope someone else knows what I’m talking about because I’m starting to think I’ve gone a bit crazy! (That or I have a funny scene for a new film) Thanks ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_of_Dixie_(season_1)	Hart of Dixie (season 1)
659	I don’t really have any memory of this film. It’s a comedy. Theres a good chance it’s R rated. It’s fairly well-known- fairly mainstream. The Dvd cover is of the main characters (i.e. the dads- they’re in their 30’s to early 40s) sliding down a water slide like a bunch of kids. It might be the one with the dads doing crazy shit like drugs and sex and shit. This is a terrible description but I’m sure someone can tell me the title of the movie just based on the fact that it’s a comedy and the DVD cover is of dads sliding down a water slide.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grown_Ups_2	Grown Ups 2
129	Ok so I remember my mom, aunt, and I rent a VHS either in the late 80’s or early 90’s that was great! I vaguely remember a male high school student got a job at a morgue(?). Some popular students(like 4 of them) were driving down the road (maybe in a convertible) and got into an accident with a big rig. They turned into zombies.. And it ended with the kid working at the morgue burning up the zombies in the crematorium. It was hilarious and scary all wrapped together. Have been searching for this film for years and have never found it again.. I think maybe the zombies talked? Or maybe not? I think he had a crush on a girl also… Wish I could remember more..	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Life_(film)	Night Life (film)
331	I remember watching a movie in the early 90s where a character put on some glasses and earphones, and connected himself to a machine where he could “feel like a woman”, I think in a sexual manner. The movie was old but presented like being in the future, that’s why that was possible. The scenes were dark and maybe loud music, that’s all I can remember. I watched it in a color TV.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Days_%28film%29	Strange Days %28film%29
622	I have been trying to figure this one out forever and just can’t! I don’t have a lot of information to put forth so I apologize. I watched it when I was around 15 I think so I saw it around 12 years ago. I don’t think it was playing on regular TV because I don’t remember commercial interruptions, I may have seen it on HBO but once again I’m not sure. I’m pretty sure it hails from the 80’s but I’m not 100% positive. All I can remember is this:  The movie was set in a futuristic society. There is one scene where “the mother” in the movie is scolding her teenage daughter for overuse of a product they call jelly. It’s something that is used for cosmetic reasons. The only other scene I remember is of the son I think – he has a black eye and uses a machine that removes it possibly by some sort of sucking mechanism.  That’s all I’ve got. I’ve tried many times looking for it on Google using those two scenes I described but have obviously not been successful. I’ve gone through countless lists like “50 weird SciFi movies from the 80’s” and still nothing. I hope this clicks for someone out there so I can finally rewatch this movie! Thank you.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Hollowheads	Meet the Hollowheads
617	This movie is probably from 90’s or early 2000. It’s a gangster type of move, a gang of young noobs, with no knowledge or consideration how things work in this dangerous area of business, by selling and acting all stupid coincidentally end up trespassing in area of a very dangerous and ruthless gangster. The scene I remember is when they are already in trouble but they are acting all cool, and whole hell is about to get loose upon them. It’s night time, heavy rain is falling, the gang is in house, outside is field with short grass. One of gang member is young blond guy, around 25 yeas old, and he is in relationship *cough* with another female gang member; there is also another member but he’s not important. While they are chilling a ruthless gangster assaults them, threatening and asking why did they do business on his turf and so on. He forces blond guy, who is naked because of “relationship” thing to dig grave outside (rain, green grass), after which he (or all of them) is(are) instructed to enter the grave, and than gangster threatens to kill them. He doesn’t kill them, but he sure makes a remarkable impression. That is all I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_(film)	Homegrown (film)

509	I am trying to find a German language film (which is in all likelihood also a German production) about a woman with relationship problems. An early scene shows the main female character swimming in a pool (public, not private) with her husband. She is completely naked and filmed from underwater, and they are alone in the pool. Her relationship with her husband deteriorates and they start spending time apart. She courts a young man of East Asian background throughout the rest of the film. In the one scene I remember most vividly, she is seen riding through a car tunnel on her bicycle. At the end of the tunnel she hits and rips off the left mirror of a stationary car(standing in the middle of the road), which happened to be her husband’s car with him inside it. I suspect she may have done that deliberately as her husband had been waiting for her on that same spot before, in an earlier scene where she identically rides the bicycle through the tunnel. In another scene the East Asian man visits her at home, where she tries to entice him while taking a bath, until they are interrupted by her mother who brings her a phone call from her husband. She and her husband never get back together. The film ends with her and the East Asian man traveling on a subway/urban train late at night where she sits on his lap and kisses him while he is disinterested, after which they are seen walking to his apartment where she was anticipating to have sex with him but this never happened, he rejected her advances and behaved awkwardly toward the end. The next morning she wakes up in his apartment totally depressed for having lost her husband and having failed to make the other man her new boyfriend. The German actress playing the main female character somewhat resembles Martina Gedeck and has jet black hair. She looked to be in her early 30s and was absolutely stunning. Her husband is of similar age, and blond & blue-eyed. The film must have been produced in the 2000s, although early 2010s and late 1990s might also be possible. I watched it three years ago (on the internet) so it cannot be newer than 2012. It is set in a large or mid-sized German city, and many scenes take place at night showing empty streets. The film is about relationships but the atmosphere of the film is very much gloomy, cold and not melodramatic at all. All the characters talk very little, and there is almost no music in the film. It is definitely a so-called ‘arthouse’ or alternative film and not aimed at mass markets at all, which is why my searches for it have been unfruitful.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Days_Between	The Days Between
421	It’s a very disturbing film, german as far as I remember, where the main character is relentlessly obsessed with killing. Shortly after being released from a mental institution, he breaks into a seemingly vacant house, but shortly after, the inhabitants (one of them on a wheel chair) come back, and the carnage begins… At some point, he painstakingly drags a body throughout a tunnel under the house, towards the car. I also remember that, by the end of the film, he is involved in a car accident which reveals the body of one of his victims in the trunk.

447	I vaguely recall awaking at a sleepover in the third grade or so – it would have been in 2003 – and finding the television on, playing late-night movies. One such movie involved a group of teenagers or young adults that had a band (or were aspiring to be a band). The main character a female, had a father who had turned a sunken ship into a tourist attraction, but then there was something about a ghost boy who had died when the ship had sunken, and it turned out that he only wanted his jacket to be returned to him…I think. I’m fairly certain that the movie was in color, and it’s been an awfully long time since I saw that, so I’m sorry if some of the details turn out to be wrong or mixed up. This is just driving me crazy!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Weird	So Weird
578	I am dying to find this movie, I think it was from the 90’s. It was about a bunch of passengers on a train or bus or something who find out that they are ghosts. And then they go around possessing people to live out their final wishes so they can move on to the afterlife? At some point a singer ghost possesses someone on stage and sings, but other than that I can’t remember anything about this movie.

Scientist talking at one point shows experiment where he’s talking about how long something can live, cuts the head off a snake, tells dude to try to pick up snake head and dude almost gets bit. Another scene he’s with the girl in bed laying his head in her chest and jumps up worried cause he can’t hear her heartbeat.

980	This has driven me nuts for the last 25 years. Seen a couple of times on British TV in the 70’s in the afternoon, in color (I think), an anthology comedy consisting of three stories (I think), made in the 1960’s (I think). No idea of stars, no memory of the content of the other  two stories, just a strong memory that the first story was about a woman in an English country house with pet tarantulas whose offspring were giant spiders (large dog sized). The climax involved the British police raiding the house and comically fighting the spiders, hitting them with bed pans, etc, simple effects that I remember being accomplished by shooting real spiders in a miniature house. I have tried to find any information on what this film might have been over the years, but with no luck. Any ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_My_Success_(1965_film)	The Secret of My Success (1965 film)
859	Ok, so a few years ago I saw a film on tv (I think it may have been on TCM) I didn’t watch the whole thing, but I remember this one scene where a girl goes running through the street crying “Rape!” I’m pretty sure she even knocks on someone’s door. No one seems to take her seriously though…people look out their windows, but no one tries to help her from what I remember. I don’t actually remember a rape scene, and she may have been lying.

1022	I saw this movie about 15 years ago on TV when I stayed home sick from school one day. It was about a girl who was kidnapped by a couple who raised her as their own child. I don’t remember how, but when she was in college she somehow found out that she had been kidnapped. She does her own investigation, and finds her real family. The thing that stands out to me most is that she had red hair, and when she meets her real family, they all have red hair too, even the mom and dad.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Face_on_the_Milk_Carton	The Face on the Milk Carton

627	Hello! I am trying to find a movie for one of my patrons at a library. She couldn’t remember the title. She thought it took place in medieval Europe and a fifteen year old girl with very curly hair is taken from her family’s castle and accused of witchcraft. Somehow the accusation was related to her eating something taboo on a regular basis. It’s possible she laughs when they come to get her. The girl is imprisoned for years and is raped multiple times by the jailer and becomes pregnant. Her daughter looks just like her. Eventually she and her daughter are released from prison and it has been so long that the woman has trouble with seeing in sunlight. Her jaw is also deformed or broken or locked or something for an unknown reason. She returns to her family home and an artist finds her there and becomes obsessed with her and paints her for the rest of his life. The daughter becomes wealthy because she is savvy. The jailer dies and his casket is taken away in a horse-drawn carriage. I have no definite names of characters or places. No well-known actors according to my patron. My patron also thought that “haunting” or “ghost” might be in the title though I have had no luck with those. She thought she watched the movie in 2011 but that it came out around 2000.  In my experience, patrons can confuse and combine multiple books or films so don’t think that it has to hit all of these points or it is not the right movie. Does this sound familiar, even vaguely, to anyone?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goya%27s_Ghosts	Goya%27s Ghosts
445	For the longest time I’ve searched to find the title for this movie but have had no success. The movie begins with a brother and sister walking to school. They cross the road which is all cobblestone so I’m assuming it’s a European movie. As they cross the road, the girl gets hit by a car and put into a coma. The family tries everything to wake her but they have no success. They finally find a doctor who says he can put the brother into a coma to rescue her and bring her back so he connects their brain waves through wires or something. The brother finds his sister at a cabin. She is on the pond playing and she slips through the ice. Her brother runs to save her and can bring her out of the water. This wakes her from the coma. I believe the girls name is possibly Frankie. I’m not too sure though. I saw this movie before 2010 but after 2000. It was on tv. It was in color, but very dark. Please try to find it! Hopefully someone else remembers this. My mom remembers but can’t remember the name of it either :/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lazarus_Child	The Lazarus Child

948	Hello Everyone !!!  I watched this movie a long time ago, I think it was this high school or college movie where a girl was raped by probably someone she knew like her friends boyfriend,when it happened she picked off a button from his shirt or jacket but maybe he was wearing a mask, she told her friend about it, but sometime later she was talking to him and noticed the same jacket or shirt he was wearing was missing a button then she said “it was you” and ran away. I think in the movie the girl mentioned that it was either a green button or a green shirt or jacket, I think I watched it in the 80s or 90s, that’s all I remembered about the movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Strangers	Family of Strangers
177	It’s not actually a movie that I don’t remember. I saw a short clip and I want to know which movie or tv show it’s from. The clips shows a girl with her hands tied up in a tree and then her captor who resembles a redneck with two hunting rifles with him said that the doctor is taking his time and he wants the girl to scream. The girl refuses, the captor then decides to strip down her pants and do something with her (I think he fingered her) to make her scream. The girl still didn’t scream. At the end something spooked the captor and said “we’re going out there”. He then untied the girl and dragged her along with her pants still half way down. The girl is wearing a blue shirt and grayish pants and kinda looks like Amy Adams at first glance but she’s not. Judging from the clip. I Think the movie is kinda recent maybe around 2010 above. And I also think the clip has cuts on it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Ground_(2016_film)	Killing Ground (2016 film)

1060	I believe this is a kids movie I saw on TV in the mid to late nineties. It was in color, in English, and may have been on one of the kids channels. The main characters are a sister and her younger brother, a family friend who is like a big silent bouncer or bodyguard, and a young suave guy they meet. It’s an adventure-fantasy in some sort of future dystopia. I remember a couple of scenes… Suave guy sees the sister fight off some military types and invites her to escape with him through a security checkpoint in the desert by racing their flying boards past the guards. They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they’re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney. She gets out of the straps by shimmying the gurney until the bottom release button is hit, then stretches her legs over her head to hit the top button. She wanders around the facility, running into the brother of a friend that is so doped up he doesn’t even know who he is. She is recaptured, and suave guy and co. break in to save her. The group have almost made it to safety when their way is blocked and bodyguard dude has to sacrifice himself to ensure their escape. The final scene shows the kids running around a beach playing and enjoying their new-found freedom while suave guy does a voiceover. It’s crazy the things we remember and the things we don’t… But if anyone can tell me what this movie is I’d be eternally grateful!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Runners	Doom Runners
223	Can anyone remember this strange film where a man wants to sleep with a woman and after she leaves, his Penis mutates into a big monster, that bites into his face and kills him? I think in that movie, there were strange crawling creatures, that looked like trilobites or giant isopods. They came from a strange aparatus which could have been a time machine, portal to another dimension or something like that. In one scene you could see a monster in this machine, that looked somewhat like the creature from “nightbeast”. One other scene, I remeber was that sombody takes off his shirt and the chest is full of moving segments like his body is mutating into one of these isopod like creatures. And in another scene, a woman awakens in a sickroom and touches the roses that have been given to her from visitors and these roses shrivel and wither like they have been put into liquid nitrogen and freeze dried. I think it was this woman, who turned the mans penis into the giant carnivorous worm creature and mabe she was like that because she was attacked by one of the strange isopods. But my memories are very blurred, I cant even remember a single dialogue. But I can remeber, that the penis scene frightened me to death and after that, I stoped watching. I saw this movie long time ago. When I was a child, my parents used to buy old VHS cassets from garage sales. Normaly we used them to record TV films, but some of them contained watchable movies. One of them had this strange film on it and was so frightening to me back then. It has been around 1995 to 1998, that I watched it, but the record must have been older. My memories are blurred, I think it was in german language, but probably just a translation. I would guess it was some kind of an american 80’s science fiction horror B-Movie. The Movie was definitely in color and looked like rather low budget, but heavily loaded with absurd body horror and strange mutations. The scenes I remember are scattered and probably twisted, because so much time passed since than and I never saw this movie again. I hope, I dont mix two films together. But I can clearly say, that it is not “Tromeo and Juliet”, which is the only other movie with a “penis monster”, that I know. My parents dont remember the title either, but they recall the movie to be over the top and gruesome and I doubt they will find the original VHS record any time soon. Maybe they have been so disgusted, that they deleted it. I would be very happy if anyone could help me with this film, because I could not manage to find the movie with the help of Google or IMDB, although I searched for days.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamillions	Kamillions
587	Ok so I don’t have that many details because I wasn’t the one who watched the movie but basically someone was telling me about this movie. And its about guardian angels who make sure you do exactly what needs to happen to follow your fate or whatever. And one time an angel wasn’t paying attention, and this guy drops his cup (i think) which makes him leave his house 2 minutes later or something like that, and leads him to run in to someone who he wasn’t supposed to. And then they fall in love but they aren’t supposed and I guess the angel has to fix it? Not sure. Again, I wasn’t the one who saw the movie but I know it had to have come out before July 2011. That all I know. Thanks in advance for any help you guys may have!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adjustment_Bureau	The Adjustment Bureau
985	I’m trying to figure out a movie my husband saw in the 90s. He says it’s either from 80s or 90s, US, about a guy who gets burned in a building in the beginning of the movie that a bad guy set on fire. Instead of dying, he gets sent to a different or alternate universe where the bad guy doesn’t know him and is rich. The main guys gets some powers from a demon or something in this alternate universe and is supposed to lead an army or something. He eventually kills the bad guy at a party.  That’s all hubs can remember, hopefully someone’s heard of this!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(1997_film)	Spawn (1997 film)
326	Hi everyone, I would really appreciate it if you could help me find this movie. I saw it on TV a couple of years ago, can’t be more then ten years ago. It was in color and it ended with written text about what happened to the people after the movie ended like they often do in movies about actual events. Here’s what I remember: There’s a young guy who constantly wears an odd knit hat. He meets a girl. She asked him why he always wears that hat and he says it is because a lot of your body heat is lost through the top of your head. She asked if he needs to wear especially this hat, he says no and they exchange his hat at the lost and found. During the movie, the girl keeps contemplating selling her eggs because she needs the money, at the end of the movie she doesn’t have to sell her eggs after all for some reason. I hope someone out there knows just what movie I’m talking about. Thanks for thinking along.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loser_(film)	Loser (film)
771	I watched this movie on Netflix in 2014 and all I remember is: in the beginning there’s a coffee shop scene…and then a girl falls in love with a guy who is a recovering drug addict. They get married and they’re mentored by an older black couple, and then at the end the husband dies of a heart attack playing flag football or something in the park. Then the old couple adopts the wife and her newborn baby.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_Love	Feast of Love
477	One more for today because ya’ll are amazing and I’m excited to finally find all these movies that I can only remember fragments of. I can only remember one scene from this movie, but I’m pretty sure it’s about a family that is a bit dysfunctional. If I recall correctly, a guy and his kids (maybe his wife too, but she might have either left or died. I don’t remember a wife) have to go stay with his father/the kid’s grandfather for some reason. I think the guy and his dad are either estranged or don’t have a very good relationship. I saw it in the mid-late 90’s and I remember this guy fell out of the widow of an apartment. He might have been pushed, I can’t remember. He was saved by landing on a flag pole that was sticking out of the building…painful but better than death. Pretty sure it was a comedy.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folks!	Folks!
1000	I watched portions of this movie on a trip to Mexico in 2008 when I was about 12. It was an American movie from the 90s to early 00s. A scene that stuck to my mind was the wealthy girl and the main guy leaving the girl’s mansion after meeting up with her dad. They drove back to the college in a convertible and there was a jump cut to her riding his dick in a forest and then it jumped back to them driving back to the college. While at the college I guess he tried acid for the first time and there were several scenes shot from his perspective. I think he also might have been on a basketball team. It’d be great to know what this movie is, I’d like to actually watch it. Thanks in advance	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Man	Harvard Man
987	I can’t remember to save my life!! I remember the walls of the place are blue. The guy is either John Cusack or an actor that is similar to his appearance or acting style. So he’s at the counter and he see’s someone he knows in the store and he says hi or whatever. Then he goes to the clerk, and says “I’m looking to rent the film ‘8 1/2? and the clerk says something along the lines of “we have 7 3/4….?’  Or something like that?!?! Please help. My boyfriend and I are dying trying to remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_World_(film)	Ghost World (film)
973	Ok, so all i remember from this movie is this one scene. A guy (possibly Brendan Gleeson, but since I’ve tried looking up his movies, I’m starting to doubt it’s him) wants to kill another guy. Since he knows he’s gonna get searched for weapons, he gets a very small gun and hides it in his underwear. He goes to see this guy then, and while they are sitting down and talking, he puts his hand down his pants. This guy looks at him funny (or asks him what he’s doing, i don’t remember exactly) and he just tells him he got an STD from a hooker or something like that. When he manages to adjust the gun properly he shoots the guy (don’t remember if he actually kills him). Well that’s all i remember. I will be very grateful if someone can figure out which movie this is, it’s been killing me for weeks! Thanks in advance!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guard_(2011_film)	The Guard (2011 film)
991	A guy is in an outdoors penal colony or prison of sorts, with a chain attached to him, (potentially forced to work?) and he almost gets pulled in to a giant spinning fan or something in the ground (not sure if that was accidental or punishment for bad behaviour). It’s in colour, not sure if for tv or cinema, and probably released no earlier than late 1990s. I think it’s a sci-fi and not horror. Sorry for being so vague but that’s all I remember at the moment, so any help would be much appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_(2015_film)	Arrowhead (2015 film)
441	Another movie I saw on TV as a child during the 90s, in color and I’m assuming in English (the scene I watched didn’t have any actual speaking in it). I only caught it during the final scene. A guy is walking up a hill wearing nothing but swim trunks, from a beach if I remember correctly.  He seems distraught, and it begins to rain. At one point he passes by a tennis court and stares at it for a moment, sinister laughter echoing out as he looks. I think the laughter continues on in a couple other places he passes before he arrives at the steps of a house. While he tries to get the door open, the camera pans over to a broken window and goes inside – the room is dark and ransacked. Going back to the man who seemingly gives up and kneels down on the steps in defeat, the camera pans out and the credits begin to roll. The only other detail I remember is that it was playing dramatic/intense music during the scene.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swimmer_(film)	The Swimmer (film)
491	Alright, so I remember this animated halloween movie that used to come on every year when I was little (around the early to late 2000’s) about this group of kids, and the main character was a boy who I think gets dared to go into this haunted house while they were out trick or treating. I can’t remember if it was actually haunted or not, I just know there was this bully who kept pressuring them to go inside. I think at one point they do end up going, and get stuck inside. Or something like that. Can’t remember the ending or anything really past that. It’s not 2D animated, and it’s not the movie “Monster House”. Though the art style is kind of similar? It was CGI. It either aired on cartoonnetwork, nickelodeon or disney channel. It really bothers me that I can’t find this movie! I used to watch it every year on halloween. If anyone could help, that’d be great!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Godmother#Film_adaptations	Scary Godmother#Film adaptations
1044	I caught the ending of this movie several times on cable in the 80s. It was in color, and the version I saw was in English, but it might have been overdubbed because it had a very continental European vibe to it, possibly French. Made in the 70s or 80s. The villain was some kind of religious cult leader, I think. The good guys needed to steal some sort of magical artifact, maybe a stone, that was under very tight security. One of them asked how they were going to do it. The main character replied something like, “Simple. We’ll fly.” The heist involved the use of climbing ropes and carabiners to cross the room along the ceiling to avoid setting off the alarms. When the main character finally gets the magical stone, its power turns him into some kind of half-monster, like half of his face becomes deformed. But it also gives him the power to beat the bad guy. That’s about all I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_of_the_Four_Crowns	Treasure of the Four Crowns

430	Ok so think I saw this movie sometime in the early 2000s. It was in color, was animated, and probably a children’s movie. I don’t remember that much about it. I’m pretty sure there was a group of friends who had a band or something? I believe one of the charecters might have been a humanoid rabbit but I’m really not sure. Also, I think he had a crush on another character (who probably didn’t like him that way). I know for sure that they sang the song “You Really Got Me” at one point in the film. It’s driving me crazy that I can’t remember anything else! (I’m not even sure if what I remember is right!).

680	Besides a plot or scene description, consider adding the following information to help people identify your mystery movie: I don’t really remember watching this, it randomly popped into my memory, but I feel like it was in the last year or two. There wasn’t any talking at all and it was in color. It had to have been newer because it wasn’t grainy. It wasn’t a full length movie, maybe just a short film or the opening to a different film? There’s a naked cave woman and she gets separated from people she knows. I don’t remember if it’s just one person or multiple or how they were separated. She’s pregnant and gives birth to a baby alone. She spends time wandering and starving unable to feed her child. She ends up finding and eating a like raw egg(s?) so she can breastfeed it. While she’s climbing the a tree she hides her baby in brush. Something comes and I think tries to eat the baby but she tries to fight it. I feel like by the end she’s dead?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series)	The Leftovers (TV series)

There is a run down old church on the town square. Also, there is an antique shop where the visiting lady borrows an old book. Some of the towns people are evil but the old preacher in the church is not. I think the lady that runs the antiques shop is the daughter of the old preacher. The movie set is very simple but very creepy. The towns people are equally as creepy.

And then there’s this evil old lady that tries to cut down the trees and kill the forest. The cats, trees, ferrets, and the old lady’s  cat team up to try to stop her. They succeed in the end!

300	Was it a goosebumps episode maybe (although it looked like a movie as it was on the TV many times)? It was on the TV in the 90’s and beginned with siblings (1brother and 1sister about 10) in their room trying to sleep when their TV would turn on by itself many times with a man asking them to take part of a TV game. (or some like that). He was addressing it directly to them, he was talking to them through the TV. When they would be there, he would talk to them about many things I don’t remember and then the little boy would be seated on a chair that would go up and up with him screaming as we would see a bunch of scary white faces (or masks) in a circle (maybe 8 of them).

117	So I’m trykng to find the title of a movie, that I can only remember bits and parts of. I remember a sex-scene between a woman and a man on a pool-table. I don’t know who the actor was, but I think she had short, drak hair and was wearing a dress in the movie. Not sure about this. Later on the woman gets run over by a truckdriver, who’s looking at a figurine on his dashboard. I remember the movie having flashbacks. Like first it played out by something happening, and the woman didn’t get run over. But later on another person did someting that made something else happen (like a domino-effect), which in turn got the woman run over.   I saw the movie on tv, it was in color and somewhere between 1998 and 2009.

It is just one scene really, and it’s of a man in a public restroom and his hand is either placed or pulled under the stall into the next one, and he gets his fingers cut off.

592	This is a Horror film made for TV about a journalist–a man–who accidentally discovers that what he writes happens after he writes it (not before, as with normal journalism). A friend of his is playing a friendly game of sand-lot baseball, and just before this he has written a short fiction story about a man who is killed by a baseball or baseball bat. His friend in real life is killed horrifically in this way. Then he is assigned to a crackerbox-style house in a nondescript neighborhood. He meets a woman journalist there, and they begin to explore this house for information for their journalism piece. It is broad daylight, and they know a murder has occurred there. I think they both get so spooked they have to leave. The feeling of this film is horrifying. Wish I had watched it all, but I am a writer myself and, weirdly, I was too scared to finish it. I’d love to know the name of this little gem.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Eyes	Evil Eyes
970	About 2 months ago I saw a horror movie about a woman being stalked by a deer like demon. I saw a lot of movies that night, mostly foreign horror movies from scandinavian countries and some european countries. I don’t remember if it was in english or not since I saw it with subtitles. The main character is a blonde short hair woman that moves or lives in a small rural town. I don’t remember if she kills her husband/boyfriend but she does kill someone. I do remember the ending since that’s what made me want to watch it (a friend recommended it). The woman wakes up naked and goes to the door, walks out to the forest near her house and there the demon slowly materializes, revealing that it has a deer skull for a head. That’s all I can remember. The movie was made in some where in the line of 2009-2013.

597	I saw this move in the early 90s but it looked older, most likely 80s but maybe 70s. The movie is developed in a funerary house, or at least part of it, on the ground level the house is like a regular funerary house with a small chapel-like room, and the basement is where the bodies are “prepared” for the funeral. The “bad guy” is a tall pale man who wears a suit, and I’m pretty sure he wears a hat too. On the last scene, the bad guy, who apparently survived to the usual horror movie drama is seen walking on the funerary house hallway until he reaches a body on an open coffin, he then grabs a syringe and pinch the body extracting (or maybe introducing) some sort of white-yellow-ish translucent liquid to the dead body. We can then see that after removing the syringe from the body, the bad guy licks a drop of the liquid that was dripping from the needle of the syringe. I cant remember well, but I’m pretty sure that the liquid played an important role in the movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasm_(film)	Phantasm (film)

I think I remember a young girl who was tied to a tree in the woods. There was a blonde woman who said something about blood and Satan. There may have been a telepathic connection between her and the girl. Maybe the woman was trying to find her. There may have also been a witch, but maybe not.

456	Hi everyone, I was talking with friends about movies and TV shows that really scared us as kids and ever since then this as been driving me mad. The movie starts with a cult chaining up a tree on a stormy night and then the tree starts to shake. Then a group of kids decide to build a tree house on this tree and they awaken an ancient monster and it escapes from the ground and attacks them. Other than that, all I can remember is the kids fill up squirt guns with milk they stole from the grocery store and they then kill the monster with the milk. I think the monster itself was the scary part, not the plot or anything. The monster had horns I think.

396	So, I caught part of a horror movie on television years ago and have been trying to find out what it was ever since, but unfortunately I don’t have much to go on. The only scene I remember is of a woman with dark hair sitting in front of a mirror, and she saw her hair move by itself in a really noticeable way–I think there was a ghost? I’m also pretty certain (but not 100%) the room she was in was rather red, I’m not sure if it was the lighting or the actual room. I don’t know when the movie was made but I saw it more than 5 years ago. Is this scene familiar to anyone?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_(1999_film)	The Haunting (1999 film)
365	This might have just been a dream, but i’m 99% sure it’s a movie. I remember two scenes from the movie, one was set in a corridor (possibly a subway platform), the walls and floor seemed to be made out of bathroom/kitchen tile, and a person was running down the corridor away from some invisible force that was making the fluorescent lights on the ceiling go out one-by-one. The other scene was set in a house, same story. The lights were going out inside the house, and I remember clearly that if anybody touched the shadows, then they disappear or are injured. I also remember a woman with a blonde Marge-Simpson hair due.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_on_7th_Street	Vanishing on 7th Street
670	Help me out, guys!! I saw this a looong time ago, I was a kid then and from what I can remember it was like a Thing rip-off with a group of characters in a militar base or something like that. This creature took the form of your worst fear and transform in it to kill you (yep, just like in Stephen King´s “IT”) like an old scientist with the fear of an old creepy circus freak-like woman and other character who was looking up for a test monkey or something and then she´s killed bye the creature trasnformed into a mutan monkey….WTF The most prominent part that I remember is the ending with a lady scientist opening some kind of multi-dimensional portal to the creature´s world and looking through it saying “There are millions of them” and getting killled. There´s also a part with two test subjects (male and female) totally naked in some crionic tubes…..just for fan-service. Well, that´s it….the only other part that I remember mostly is when the black comic relief guy dies off-screen, like in a “woosh” from the MC perpective at the other side of an elevator. I hope you can help me!! ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowzone_(film)	Shadowzone (film)
409	A movie seen in the early 90’s on tv. Pretty sure it was from the early 90’s, if anything, the late 80’s. There was a scene where a woman was pinning a girl down in a full mount and holding down her arms. They’re in the backyard of a house and it’s brightly lit from the lights and the pools lanterns. Then a closeup of the woman’s chest shows something crawling up from the inside. From her mouth, a centipede-looking thing comes out of her mouth and she tries to pass it into the girl’s mouth. Two people then run out, a girl (mother? sister? cousin? friend?) and a guy. They knock her into the pool and the guy chucks a propane tank in, too. He shoots the tank with a gun and it explodes, killing her. There was also an earlier scene in which someone was pointing a gun at the woman and she dared them to shoot her. When they shot her in the head, she just leaned back and raised her head back up with a new bullet wound.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(1988_film)	The Kiss (1988 film)
791	ok to start out, I saw this movie around 2008-2010. It was in English and full color. The only scene I can remember is a guy breaks into a family’s house, the father goes to check it out. They get into a fight and the father somehow gets his head stuck in the railing of the staircase. Then the killer uses a dresser or something to kill the father. Later on, one of the younger boys that likes to dress as a cowboy, runs into a cornfeild with the killer chasing him. All you see is a flash followed by the sound  of a shotgun. The main protagonist is a 20 something girl with short hair,which is either blonde or brunette. After he kills the rest of the family he takes one of the boys and as he leaves the protagonist sneaks into the van and the rest of the movie is her trying to save him. Thanks to whoever can help me!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Tension	High Tension
471	Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling with this one for years. I was probably around 5 when I seen this movie on TV so that would put the year around 1995. I can’t remember much of it. But what I do remember is a man killed his wife and buried her in the backyard, I remember a dog digging up her hand and bringing it to him (I think), and I remember her zombie self stalking him around the house. She may have had a blueish face from being dead. Hope you can help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(1986_film)	House (1986 film)
563	I saw this on TV at my grandparents’ house likely sometime around 2005-2006. It was in color, and the scene I most vividly remember is one where a little girl is struggling to climb out of a small hole in the ground filled with water. She’s blonde and I believe she was wearing some kind of red clothing. The setting of all this looked like a parking garage, but it may have had some more abstract scenery as well. A couple finds the girl in the pool, and they rush to her aid. But as they’re pulling her out, a pair of green hands grabs onto the back of her clothes and tries to pull her back in. That’s all I can remember, but I hope it’s enough.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_III	Poltergeist III
407	I think I saw it back in the 80’s, this horror movie that gave me nightmares for weeks. It had these bad ass looking monsters that came out of a van and well…killed people. I remember there was one with a sword who, at some point, beheaded a guy who was with his girlfriend at a bench in a park. I also remember, towards the end there was this costume party, where the monsters blended right in… And in the end, they all gathered up inside an old van… What’s the movie name???	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Maniacs	Neon Maniacs
651	There was this movie a long time ago that played on TV, at least 10 years ago, where the lead was a blonde Caucasian. I don’t recall ever finishing the movie therefore I would like to find it. What I could remember: The movie starts out with an older Asian man (around 40) being chased by a dark flying evil spirit through the woods, and him tripping along the way at which the demon catches up and supposedly gets eaten, I think, due to the fact it cuts to the next scene before the supposed getting eaten part. Then it follows a blonde Caucasian woman, who is the lead, that moves into an Asian country with her Asian husband and Asian son. This Asian country, I assume, is China due to the fact during the exposition people are offering money and fruits by throwing them into small fires or lighting candles and sticks as offerings. It just so happens the blonde woman begins to have headaches followed by hallucinations when they moved to this Asian country, and it was later discovered that her son is also susceptible to these hallucinations as well. These hallucinations include; evil spirits that apparently eat people, visions of dead ghosts, etc. One particular scene I remember is that while eating dinner her son refuses to eat the food but she insists he does, but when she looks at her own food it turns into wiggling worms, she gasps then looks at her plate again and nothing. Another scene I remember is that when she goes to the market she sees an evil spirit that I think proceeds to follow her until she runs into another store where the man manages to wave the spirit away with smoke. She later asks him for something to help with the headaches, so he offers her a crushed fish head mixed in some fluid (I think), he said this orally not physically offer her it, of course she refuses. The last scene I could remember was that her son was sleep walking or possessed by I think and evil spirit that was female, and they walk into a dye or clothing factory and black dye comes out of the kids mouth, I think. If anyone could provide a list of potential movies that would be great.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Wait	They Wait
963	I remember this horror movie where a couple had twins ( baby boys) and the family was being attacked by a demon,when the demon was coming alot of black birds would appear, so the husband went to a witch doctor for help, she was smoking a pipe and she gave him something to protect himself from the demon and she told him when he’s coming back he must wear red carnations or carnations so she knows that its him, in the end he defeated the demon and the birds disappeared.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Half_(film)	The Dark Half (film)
473	This is an older 80 s movie. Maybe early 90s. I remember a old lady doing the killing .she may be a ghost , also a guy gets killed out side on a ladder in the rain at night. I also remember a long haired stoner kind of guy that makes a weapon with a saw blade. The house that this happens in is having work done and the guy that makes the weapon is a carpenter .	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Dudes_in_the_House	Dead Dudes in the House
658	I was very young, approximately 1969. At the drive-in with my parents, it was a double feature ,and after Swiss Family Robinson ,there was this horror movie ,I only remember one image. There was a clothed body with its head apparently chewed off with only a bloody neck stump exposed, then they pan over to the other side of the room and there was a guilty looking cat sitting there.. It might have been a black cat I don’t remember for sure. I’m pretty sure that the scene was alluding to the fact that the cat was the killer? I don’t know for sure.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Garden_(film)	Torture Garden (film)
236	I can’t really remember much. All i remember is that a group of people were like trapped in a place with transparent mirrors and it opens and closes from time to time and then the people would get stucked in the room made by the mirrors and then there are different monsters that comes out that would kill the people in that enclosed space. Then later they discovered a wheel and some history about where they are? Not really sure but that’s how the movie goes. I can’t really remember more please help me i really need to know it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Ghosts	Thirteen Ghosts
641	This would’ve been an 80s or 90s film, my sister got it from a rental place around the late 90s. The main thing I remember is that a woman wakes up in a hospital to find out that her arms and legs are missing. It was a shock reveal where they pulled the blanket off her. There were a few people (including a police officer/detective?) consoling her that this was for the best. Where my memory gets fuzzy is that there may have been some monster/demonic presence/other evil involved and her limbs have been sacrificed in some way after she tried to escape, but I might be imagining this.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon_(film)	Necronomicon (film)
160	The movie I only watched 10 or 15 minutes of on HBO in the 1980’s, has scarred me to this day. Probably will look super cheesy to me now. I caught the movie in the middle I think. I remember characters wearing a lot of brown so I think the film was probably made in the late 70s or early 80s. I only remember two scenes clearly. Scene A: Middle aged man (and a woman?) stand over a sleeping child. They hold their hands out over the child and the legs deflate like a balloon. It is as if they are sucking the life out of it. Scene B: A reptilian alien leader addresses a crowd over a large view screen. I think he was wearing a suit and tie!? LOL. For some reason this movie freaked me out big time. I had trouble sleeping for years afterward. Any help is greatly appreciated in re-living this childhood scare to as an adult.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Invaders	Strange Invaders
872	Okay, this one is going to be packed with random info. I saw this movie on television in the early 90’s when I was 4-5 . The movie was in English and it was in color. I would say the movie is probably from somewhere in the early-to-mid 80’s. A boy walks into a room and notices someone sleeping (or dead) and takes an item from them and walks out. He’s shown to be the stereotypical nerd with glasses and a tucked in, button up shirt. There were scenes of him putting on headphones and tinkering around with what seemed to be a giant computer or radio system. In one class, a bully teases him and he makes a mixture in a beaker and pours it on the bully’s arm. Turns out it was acid. Later on at home, the parents are going out and hire an older woman to babysit him and his sister. One scene has the woman pouring milk for her kitten and puts a box over it as its drinking, but later when she lifts up the box, the kitten is gone. I think the boy appears holding and petting it before her. The boy is shown in either the front yard or backyard, setting up a light sensor system. The bully shows up later, now with a bandaged hand and crosses the sensor, alerting the boy. I think they end up in the garage when the boy shows up with a sword and spiked helmet. A piece of wood or cardboard falls when they scuffle and the bully tries to push it forward but the boy stabs the sword through, killing the bully. Don’t remember how it starts, but the boy and the babysitter fights and he ends up throwing her kitten into the fire. When she’s crying over it, he knocks her out (i think). As she’s on the ground, he gloats and pours alcohol/wine on her face/head. She gets up and I think they fight a bit more and she pushes him. He falls on top of the spiked helmet from earlier and crawls away. The parents come home and she doesn’t respond to them and gets her bike to leave, all the while they’re yelling that she drank all the alcohol. A closeup of the boy’s face is seen staring off into space and we realize he is dead. A hand reaches for his glasses and we see the little sister putting them on. She sits herself down in front of the computer/radio and puts on headphones as the scene freezes and fades out.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_(1986_film)	Twisted (1986 film)
740	I watched this movie in June of 2009 on TV. It might have been a movie or a TV show but I’m not sure. It wasn’t that old and I think it was in English. I remember a particular scene where this couple was running away from a murderer and they were both on a bridge. There was a wall that blocked the bridge halfway and the couple was trapped but the guy stalled the murderer, letting the woman get away. The murderer then kills the man and throws him off the bridge and I clearly remember it showing the body floating on the river. The setting seemed like it was in a dome and there were lots of trees and underground sewers.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper's_Island	Harper's Island
672	I remeber watching this movie maybe ten years ago it was quite old at the time. It’s maybe 20 years old. All I remember is a gunmen has taken hostages in a bank. The main character(one of the hostages) tries to reason with him throughout the movie, most of the movie is set in the bank. The main character is black. I think the gunmen needs money for his dying wife and he was recently fired also. I think at the end they find a way to save or something. Its a pretty well known film.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Q.	John Q.
669	Movie where a nuclear family was held hostage in their house I remembered two scenes from the movie:   1st scene:the teenage daughter went to the door and her boyfriend was at the door and she told him to go away and then he came back with flowers and  one of the persons holding them hostage told  her to go with her boyfriend, she went out, then her boyfriend said “I don’t know what’s going on here but let’s get out of here” and drove away.   2nd scene: when it almost finished the man holding them hostage was going to shoot the man but there was no bullet in the gun, then the man held him and pushed him outside or something like that ( there was about four persons holding them hostage, I think a woman was in it too, it’s not firewall )	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desperate_Hours	Desperate Hours
1090	This is a movie from the early to mid 80’s, in English. I remember it being a vignette format, like Creepshow or The Willies, but I was a little kid so who knows. The part I remember is a kind of Victorian-era vampire scene where at one point the action leads to a cellar/dungeon where one of the protagonists is on a slab table with a hunk of meat (or maybe one whole leg) missing as it was removed for food. In my head I see one of the vampires as Prince Humperdink, but I’m pretty sure that’s just due to Fright Night. Thoughts?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxwork_(film)	Waxwork (film)
861	I saw this movie on TV, it was probably somewhere between 2004-2008. It might have been made in the late 90s, but I’m not sure. The film was about this couple who were going somewhere for a honeymoon (I think), and traveling around this weird abandoned town. Throughout the film, they see very disturbing events, the most prominent being this scarred-up white cat. It keeps following them. Throughout the film, the husband goes insane. He’s bloodied-up and yelling all the time. At the end of the film, this worm-like creature comes up out of the ground and swallows him whole. The very end of the movie has the wife talking to the police about the experience, and a cat jumps down and knocks a drink over. The cop calls the cat something like “Lonney”, which was the name of the woman’s husband. We see that it is the same scarred-up white cat as before. The camera zooms in on its face, and the film ends. The thing I remember the most is, of course, the ending. And I’ve been wanting to find it just so I can relive it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmares_%26_Dreamscapes:_From_the_Stories_of_Stephen_King	Nightmares %26 Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King

528	Okay, I watched this movie when I was young, I’m 24 now. The only things I can remember is that it’s a semi secluded home near the woods. There was a little girl,  a boy and a woman that may or not be their mother. The woman works in the woods where she’s building a giant spiral like structure out of scrap metal. There’s a scene where the little boy runs to get the woman and when they get back to the home, the little girl is standing outside the upstairs window. The woman rushes up to get her and when the little girl sees her, she begins to scream like crazy. And when the woman turns her baseball cap around, the little girl stops screaming.

729	So i remember i watched this movie in a DVD about 3-7 years ago. It was in english, here a brief sypnosis i remember. So there is a guy who moved to another place to attend high school or to follow his dad i dont remember. when he moved there, his next door neighbour has a family consists of a father and a daughter, the father is one of his teacher in his school. the dauhter next door is very isolated and kept by his father. later in the movie, the guy gets to know the daughter and hangs around with her, but her father always keep them apart for some reason. after this character development, the guy enter the next door daughter house to found out a shelf full of books which she says to keep out because her father. the guy opens the book and it turns out a monster appears from the book, he managed to capture the monster by bringing it close to the book, the climax if this film consist of the guy found out the daughter next door neighbour is actually from a book aswell, but a diffrent one. it turns out his father writes a story on a typewriter (or just write it i dont remember), makes it into a book, and the character from the book can come to life, thats where the girl and monster come from, very late into the movie the guy accidentally released all the creatures from the book and we get to see a fight of him and the girl trying to put all this moster to the book in a amusement park, then he is forced to put the girl back to the book even though he dosent want to because the father (his teacher) told him its necesarry. in the end of the movie he feel sad because he has been in a relationship with the girl, he went to the school, greeted by the teacher and met the girl that come out of the book, later the girl burns the book while the teacher (father) watches from the distance   i would really like to know this movie title, i watched it as a kid and i want to watch it again lmao, i cant find the dvd, and i cant seem to find the title by seaching the sypnosis on google   thans very much	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps_(film)	Goosebumps (film)
413	Ok, I would have first seen this movie back quite some time ago (1990’s or before). American film, in color. I had thought this was a Tom Hanks film, but when I go through his IMDB, none of the titles/images brings it to mind, so I’m thinking in that I’m mistaken. So, what I do remember is that the main character during part of the film works as a volunteer chemical tester, being exposed to various chemical substances that among other things, destroys his sense of smell, and with it his sense of taste. He ends up working at jobs that most anyone would rather not do, since they are so unpleasant (I think one of those jobs was in a salt factory, as I feel I remember seeing him slipping and tumbling down a huge pile of some grainy/almost powdery stuff), and lives his life on the small wages he can make, and the disability checks he gets for the residual damages from the chemical exposures. I’m pretty sure it was a dark comedy, as it vacillated between the humor of the things he went through, and the dark, near empty life he led. Even touching on the fact that his limited finances weren’t too bad, as without a sense of taste, he just ate the same meals every day, cause it was cheap and easy (spaghetti). I can’t remember what else happens, just images of him in a test chamber getting flooded with various gasses/chemicals, and taking off his mask (if he even had one to begin with), and hacking/coughing/sneezing, being treated badly by bosses, and that scene of him trying to move across, or up that huge pile of near sandy stuff, slipping, tumbling and falling, and getting frustrated with it all… I know, this is pretty vague, but I’m really hoping someone can help me find this one, as I’d like to check it out again, if for no better reason than to give it context, so that isn’t the only parts I can recall about it… Thanks for any help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiffs	Whiffs
883	Movie from the mid to late 80’s where there was a street race against time I think where the guy has a device that will change the lights to green and pulls into a car wash to change the color of his car (and then a ton of other cars full of his friends pull out of too) so that the helicopter can’t follow him to impede his progress.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can_(1989_film)	Catch Me If You Can (1989 film)

They are or become friends and a lot of the movie involves these 2 characters and the girl’s younger sister, whom I believe does kiss the boy at some point. i would hazard between 2000-2010 sorry for the vagueness but any guesses at a name would be gladly appriciated.

737	I remember this film about two kids (or maybe just a boy) living with their grandparents and constantly being scared by this creepy woman with long dark hair who seems to be stalking them At first it seems like she’s the antagonist but later it’s revealed the children are hers (the product of her father’s rape). I also distinctly remember a scene (maybe the mother’s flashback?) where the father has the dark haired woman tied up and seems to be bleeding her dry.

269	I saw this on the old Prism cable network in the Philadelphia/South Jersey area in the early to mid 1980’s. It was a low budget affair, possibly independent, possibly a student production. It was in color and in English. It seemed to have been filmed in a couple of abandoned locations, including some creepy ruins of a building overgrown with vegetation. I have the impression they may have written around the areas they had available. There were, I believe, three stories, framed by a group of young people (probably college students) telling them. The image that sticks in my head all these years is of a guy hovering and dazed under a single bare, blue light bulb in a very small, grey, dingy room. The point to that story, if I recall, was how someone had previously been found like this and a guy decides to investigate and winds up sharing the same fate. I don’t remember anything else, really, but my impression is that it was a competent amateur production. It certainly creeped out my 12 or 13 year old self! Prism used to show some interesting stuff (I first saw Werner Herzog’s remake of Nosferatu there when I was maybe 11 and I became a lifelong fan of Herzog from the experience.) Early cable was without a net! Any help would be appreciated, but I have a feeling the film I’m looking for was way under the radar… Here’s hoping!

531	Alright so I saw this movie sometime in the early 2000s it was in English and it was on tv but I know it was a movie. It was about a woman who at a young age lost her mother and almost died at the funeral but a ghost saved her and from that day on the ghost protected her, then one day once she was an adult she was at a party in an abandoned house I believe and she died at first her spirit is helping her avoid the demons hiding in the darkness after her soul, it was soon reviled that her guardian spirit is actually a demon as well and her mothers spirit is trying to help from what is presumably heaven and the woman has to get to I believe the kitchen and escape through some kind of ventilation shaft or something. Admittedly I was rather young when I saw this and could be mixing up or changing some details unknowingly so if you know a movie that sounds even remotely similar please let me know.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_in_Darkness	Left in Darkness
720	Vaguely remember plot about a innocent type of girl hanging out with a wild girl who seems to be a bad influence on her.  She soon is wearing different clothes and makup than usual and generally not behaving like a good girl. They end up going to some house or apartment where they agree (for some reason) to have sex with some spanish guys (I think).  The one girl chickens out but the other girl starts having sex with the one guy who motions to the other guy to get involved.  The other guy then gets involved but whatever he’s doing she doesn’t like it and she leaves crying and the guys are pissed off.  I think the girls grow apart toward the end of the movie and the innocent girl goes back to the way she was before.  Any clue?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_%282005_film%29	Havoc %282005 film%29
571	I saw this movie about 15 or 17 years ago on TV. I just barely remember that it happened during the night at a closed shopping mall, very much Ferris Bueller style with teenagers fooling around the mall. Ad of course, the intercourse scene where the man is very much aroused, the girl is on her knees (doggie style) and super bored, painting her fingernails or maybe removing the nail polish. The movie was in English language, on color. It seemed from the early 90’s perhaps.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallrats	Mallrats

813	Looking for movie I saw when I was a kid. It may have been an episode of a TV show. Anyway, this newly married couple bought an old lighthouse or at least a house that was on a cliff overlooking the sea.The woman found a bunch of mirrors in the attic of the house that mesmerized her. She would dance in front of them. The story was a former female occupant had died in the house under suspicious circumstances, maybe she committed suicide or something. But the mirrors were haunted and the ghost arose and fought with the woman. Her husband came to help and tried to beat the ghost with a metal rod, a fire poker. Of course, the solid object went through the ghost and he actually beat his wife to death. Despondent , he thought that he saw his wife dancing in front of a window beckoning to him and he jumped through the window to his death. Another couple witnessed this whereupon the woman fainted and her husband scooped her up and rushed from the house. It was a black and white movie and I think I saw it sometime in the early ’60s on television. I have looked at The Outer Limits Episodes but could find nothing. Would like to see it again. Any help appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(American_TV_series)	Thriller (American TV series)
1018	I remember watching this horror flick about 6 years ago on some local tv channel. It was in English (American), in color, and it was probably made in the 2000s or maybe 2010. The plot was about a group of people trapped in a prison-like place with a green alien. The alien could imitate the voice and appearance of everyone it killed. It had green blood and diamond was its only weakness. The movie starts with a lady with red hair recalling the incidents and talking about them to police officers in the same prison. Then it turns out that the lady is actually the alien and it kills one of the officers. The other officer is the one who finds out about its weakness and tries to defeat it. Another scene shows the surviving officer doing the same thing the red-haired lady did, talking to some officers about what he remembers. Turns out this is the alien speaking again, not the actual officer. Also the alien laid eggs. I vaguely remember the title of the movie starting with “R”. Something like “Reptilian” maybe? However I cannot find the movie with this name, so maybe I’m wrong. Sounds quite cheesy, but help is appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilicant	Reptilicant
981	The movie I’m trying to find is one I watched over six years ago. The movie itself may be older. It was a 2d animated cartoon. I don’t think there was any talking during it. It may have been a very short movie, like 15 minutes. What I remember is that the main character went to a beach. He had these 2d shapes, and he was able to blow them up like balloons into other people. I think he made a man and a woman. He eventually popped them and I think they reverted back to their orignal shape. Then the main character stepped on a needle I think and he turned into a triangle. This movie is so hard to find. I’m not sure if it even counts as a movie. But if you have any clue, please help! Thanks	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surogat	Surogat
1031	I remember a movie with a Miles Davis song in the soundtrack. All I remember is a section from the perspective of a child in the back of a car (the narrator was an adult) and he appeared to be from a ‘made’ family of Italian-American gangsters. They had just passed a church; the boy sees his father cross himself and he follows suit. That’s all I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bronx_Tale	A Bronx Tale
111	I watched this great action movie about 20 years ago. The main character,Danko, has a plot to kill the president. He fights against 2 brothers, 1 of them is in FBI. First Danko kills their father, than kidnapped one of the brothers and forces the other to kill the president. At the end both them fight Danko in a storage area for little planes. I really miss this movie	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Retreat,_No_Surrender_3:_Blood_Brothers	No Retreat, No Surrender 3: Blood Brothers
772	so I don’t remember too much about this film, but in my searches I found transporter 3 which was very similar in my opinion. basically the movie is about this guy who is a transporter for rare stuff goes to a place with nuns and stuff in it, who want something delivered. Turns out its this girl who has never been out into the world before, and I’m pretty sure of of the nun people came with them. There was this memorable scene where they are in a massive crowd, going to a train station or something, but the girl starts running away. The station then blows up, and they find out about her psychic abilities. I remember near the end of the film, after doing the sexy time, the girl stabs and kills the transporter, to stop a heat seeking missile from finding him, then he comes back to life or something. This part could have been another film, in which case, I would also like to know this one! i watched this like 3 or 4 years ago maybe? I know it is not very recently produced, and it was definitely in the action genre. if anyone knows this film, please comment, my mind can’t handle not knowing	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_A.D.

540	okay so I watched this film in my history lesson because we were doing about discrimination about the Jews. The film talk about gangs and stereotypes. the plot from what I remember includes this white English teacher who Comes to a school with many gangs and the school is very segregated and the classes are hard to control. There is a scene where a child draws a offensive stereotyped picture and the English teacher refers back to the Jews saying they were discriminated like this. She gives them their own notebooks and they all write down their stories and by the end of the year they are a close knit family group. They even argue to have her in the last year of school which she doesn’t normally teach. I rememrb the title had some like “writing” in the title possibly. It isn’t a very well known film but any help would be amazing, thankyou	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Writers	Freedom Writers
820	A few years ago I happened upon a Japanese movie – quite recent, in color and very well done.  It involved a Japanese police homicide detective who went to work every day on a ferry, and as he travelled he began to see a face in the window of an abandoned warehouse.  The face became more and more clear every day, and it to be a woman screaming for help.  Of course, he investigated the warehouse, but found nothing on the first trip.  He returned, and the woman materialized out of a puddle of water on the floor, and then disappeared again.  After this, she would appear everytime he spilled water or tea on the floor of his apartment, or walked by a rain puddle in the street.  Very weird, and unfortunately I had someplace to go and never saw the end of it.  Dying to know if anyone recognizes it.  Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retribution_(2006_film)	Retribution (2006 film)
386	Does anyone recognize this movie? It appears to be Japanese, possibly from the 70’s, but possibly as late as the 90’s? Possibly a horror film. The recurring theme is the door to nowhere, surreal imagery, culminating with the woman in the doorframe, in the street, eventually surrounded by dancers dressed in traditional costumes, which appear to refer to folk characters or myths. The music juxtaposed with the film is at the artistry of the youtube account holder and doesn’t actually have any original relation to the film itself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDD38bG4WnQ Thanks for your assistance!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Tokyo_(film)	Neo Tokyo (film)
530	My movie is I believe a 90’s movie but maybe late 80s or early 00s. I would have seen it in the late 90s or early 00s. I think it was japanese language with subtitles but maybe dubbed. I saw it on tv but i think it was a movie. It was in color. From what i remember it was about some guys fighting against aliens who look like humans but can transform into kind of reptilian creatures. I think the aliens had control of some powerful corporation. I think one of the main guys wears glasses. One scene I really remember is a fight against a giant clock that jumps off the wall and attacks them. Near the end of the movie, there is a fight with an old guy who transforms into a creature with a bunch of tentacles. It is a live action movie not anime.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wicked_City_(1992_film)	The Wicked City (1992 film)
665	I saw a movie when I was very young, it was from the 70’s or 80’s. It’s about some people who where being attacked by demons in a house in the middle of a field or a graveyard. If you are out side the house it’s just a door their and nothing else, but when you go threw it’s a house. Please help, this movie has been racking my brain for years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Wind	Demon Wind
357	The movie was about a kid who had imaginary friends, the only one I can remember was a penguin who always made jokes and said “Zing!”. I’m pretty sure he had 3 or 4 of them and he talked to them a lot. It was a movie made, for lack of a better term, in real life and the imaginary friends were animated. He went to a high school and had a crush on a girl. Then something happened where he had to go to an amusement park and find a cold, frozen type room in the back area of a ride. He found an item there and there was a bad guy that was also looking for the item. I saw the movie in the 2000’s, probably between 2004 and 2009 or so. It was shown on either Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. It was in English and it was definitely a movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Animated	Re-Animated
832	All I remember of this film is that there is a kid in a house holding a bow and arrow and facing his father. Father tells him to put the bow down but the kid shoots him in the belly with the arrow and kills him. Any ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_(film)	Mikey (film)
584	When we were a few years old, my twin sister and I sat down and watched the strangest movie with our parents, and I haven’t been able to find it since… It starts out with a boy who gets kidnapped by these two homely-looking twin henchmen, who take him back to a sort of children’s colony/prison island. (I believe they took some sort of boat, possibly through a swamp to get there… My memory is a bit foggy…) When they arrive, they are greeted by this tough, ruthless villian-character, who forces them into doing chores or some sort of labor for him. (I remember I thought that he looked a like a Mexican luchador, but I could be wrong.) Any child that wouldn’t do so was immediately sedated and plunged into a comatose state inside what seemed to be a pod of goo. Ultimately the movie ends in all the children escaping and the boy waking up in a meat locker/basement/whatever to discover it had all been a bad dream. I remember there was also some sort of musical number… Something like an ode to the main villian (one of the henchmen had some sort of infatuation with him, idk) that went, “He’s so b-b-beautiful to me”. I know I’m not insane for remembering this because my sister remembers the same exact thing. I would guess it could be a movie from the 90s/early 2000s, at least before the year 2004. Does anyone have a to what this could be?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Two_Two_Meets_the_Hooded_Fang_(1999_film)	Jacob Two Two Meets the Hooded Fang (1999 film)
920	A movie I barely remember from childhood from the 80’s to early 90’s.  The beginning starts with a young woman or princess in a carriage being driven on a dirt path through the woods.  An evil witch causes the carriage to crash and the princess runs into the woods.  The forest turns out to be magical and protects/hides the princess from the witch.  The forest opens secret doors in the trees that contain food, hair brushes and dresses etc…  The movie is in color and English no subtitles.  I also think it may be part of a series of short animated films.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_Fairy_Tale_Classics#Series_2	Grimm%27s Fairy Tale Classics#Series 2
867	I viewed this movie many times. It was somewhere in-between 2006 to 2008. Although i do think it was 2007. I remember it being called Psycho Kids. I remember someone telling me Psycho Kids was on but they had said Psychic Kids (a TV show). I heard them wrong. I had gotten them confused a couple times. I Google the name and nothing comes up. Plot: A family moved into a new house by the woods. It was winter. Strange things were happening and there were kid ghosts (they appeared in human form) in the woods. In one scene, the oldest daughter is on her knees on a hill. She was looking for one or two of her siblings. In another, the “psycho kids” (ghost kids) were beating down the car to get to the family. I remember a boy having an axe. The kids had really weird black eyes. And their clothes seemed to be from the 1920’s. It was in color and English. It was on some type of on demand TV service. That’s why i was able to watch it so many times. I highly doubt it was an episode of anything.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_Little_Things	Wicked Little Things
644	Ok it was a movie in late 90’s early 00’s all the adults are dead from the war and all’s that is left are the kids. Some of the kids use their minds as weapons. It had very cheap graphics. I thought the title was 99 year war but upon searching, that is wrong.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_Cause_%28film%29	For the Cause %28film%29
1070	I remember seeing a movie maybe 10 years ago and there was this scene where a group of kids (I think it was two boys and a girl) go up to this old woman’s house who is rumored to be a witch. They dare one of the boys to knock on her door. It supposed to be that if you ask her, she brings out this box with like a glass ball or something in it and you’re supposed to be able to see how you’re going to die in it. The one boy goes up and sees that he’ll die on the toilet while reading a playboy. I think it was a coming of age movie, but I can’t really remember anything else, I just remember that scene. I pretty sure it was made within the last 20 years. It was in color, and english.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fish	Big Fish
976	So I remember very, very little about this movie, but maybe you can help me! It was when I was a kid that I saw it, so the late 90s is probably when it was new. I can’t remember too much, but it was about a little girl. I think there were nuns involved, and I remember some sort of chocolate cake in it. There was a fat kid who was forced to eat the chocolate cake somewhere near the end. I also remember at some point someone behind spun around by their pig tails. I cannot for the life of me remember, so I’d appreciate if someone can jog my memory!   And it was in English.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(1996_film)	Matilda (1996 film)

235	This is a family sci fi movie from the late 80’s or early 90’s. A small group of teenagers get sucked into a computer/video game. I believe that the game was set in prehistoric times and had humanoid dinosours. I mainly remember a scene where the villain was holding one or more of the heroes over a lava or fire pit. At the end the kids escape and the game has returned to normal. Not sure of much else but the film couldn’t have been any newer then around 97.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_in_Dinosaur_City	Adventures in Dinosaur City
796	alright, i saw this movie once on a tv program that was airing old movies at night. i remember that it had this little kid that was searching for his parents but he was traveling through i think space or the earth but in a kinda apocalyptic atmosphere. i knew it was kinda old by the way it looked.  the antagonist i think followed him around and appears before the protagonist several times. it was either sci fi or apocalyptic. he was blonde and kinda short. i know this is kinda vague but pls help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence	A.I.

792	Ok, so I seen this movie about 10 or so years ago on cable in america. In this movie, there was a little white boy who would break into people houses/apartments and rob them. He would brag to his friends about the robberies and how he did them. His mother was never around because she was at work all the time. He actually got caught by one couple who was at home during one of his robberies and they threatens to call the cops. At the end, he ended up setting his own apartment on fire and his mom told him they were moving.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Thief_in_the_World	The Best Thief in the World
897	Good day all. I am hoping someone can help me, finally, figure out this movie. I saw it in the late 90s, it was on VHS. There are two primary scenes I remember, and one signature line. In the first scene, at the start of the movie, a circus is happening. Two of the clowns get killed, and their faces carved off. The killer ends up using one of those faces, through most of the movie. The second scene, is towards the end. The main couple are escaping the killer, when he knocks the female down the stairs, pins her against the wall, and says “now let’s see what’s behind that pretty face of yours”. The male lead hits the killer with a board, and they escape. This movie has been stuck in my head for years, and I can’t seem to find record of it anywhere. Thank you, in advance, for all the help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clown_at_Midnight	The Clown at Midnight
355	I saw it when I was like 10, in 2004 or around there. It was on TV and I can’t tell you the original language because it was translated to Spanish. It was old, though, really old, but in color and I remember the beginning, when the king arrives to the castle with a baby in his arms and he tells his young daughter, who’s blonde, that the baby will be her sister and that he found her in the woods. The princess is excited, but when everyone leaves her alone with the baby, the baby does something (maybe bit her?) and the princess makes the baby turn over and the baby starts crying. The princess is scolded by everyone. Years later, when they’re both grown up, the princess is beautiful and fell in love? But her adopted sister who now has black hair, wants the kingdom for herself and puts like an enchantment or something on everyone so she can be hated and she can become queen. I don’t remember much more, only that the blonde princess goes into the woods and find this scarecrow (I think?) doll that used to be hers and he helps her defeat the girl who wants to take over. And the blonde princess has to fight against the prince she’s in love with for the ‘future queen’s hand’, but it’s actually to make him remember her or something.   I can’t remember anything else	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dragon_Ring	The Dragon Ring
150	i remember watching what i believe to be was a movie with short horror stories or a series. it was between 2001 to 2005 i can remember exactly when but it goes like this as much as i can remember. an african american male cop and white female cop i think was chasing someone and their car crashed. when the lasy cop come too she notices her partner is missing. she goes looking for him and ends up in a house i think where i think she goes into a the basement where she finds skulls and stuff and finds this fat white lady. in the end all i could remember is the cop waking up in a wheelchair and then she notices her legs and i think arms are amputated. ive tried so hard to find this olease help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon_(film)	Necronomicon (film)
199	Late 70s or 80s cross between Surviving the Game and Gymkata. I saw it on TV as a kid and remember the hunters all wore masks and had to choose different weapons and the main guy ended up hunting the bad guys at the end. I want to remember more but may confuse it with other movies. But the bad guys wear masks to hide their identity and I remember a fight scene in a swampy area and the final scene is at a house that seemed to be on stilts with a lot of glass and I think the bad guy was trying to get away by helicopter. It was definately a “Let’s hunt humans for fun” type movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenging_Force	Avenging Force
866	There’s a movie that I watch as a child, late 80s, probably 90s. It was on TV, we recorded it on a VHS to watch. I think it was a kids halloween movie. There were 2 kids (brother and sister possibly) And the water mill in their town was running dry. I can’t remember the adventure, but I remember the boy at the end, making a wish and skipping a rock into the dried up part where the mill was, and it magically skipped 3 times and apparently that meant his wish would come true and water appeared in the mill once again. Please help. This has been driving my crazy! Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Halloween	The Last Halloween
470	The only scene image/plot idea I have is two robbers robbing a nice house (maybe on the beach). There are occupants in the house (maybe a   boyfriend and girlfriend) who end up siding with the robbers and maybe even suggest they change their tactic on what to rob. Despite the fact that I believe the girlfriend is there with a boyfriend, I think she falls for one of the robbers. I’m so fuzzy on the actors that I almost hate to mention any, but I have it in my head that one of the robbers (which the movie follows as the lead protagonist) is a comedic actor like Woddy Harrelson, Steve Buscemi, or Danny Devito–a large and varied range, I know). The girl reminds me of Alicia Silverstone but could just as easily be someone like Beidget Fonda.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_If_by_Sea	Two If by Sea
372	The movie starts out with an American family who are staying in some East European Castle with their young son. He’s like maybe 9 or 10. I think it was in Czechoslovakia, maybe Romania. It’s night time and the boy is running around trying to escape some thing that is chasing him throughout the castle and you can hear his parents screaming. He manages to escape the castle, but his parents are killed by whatever was chasing him. Years later he comes back with his girlfriend or fiancee and their going to stay at the same castle. Little by little, his behavior becomes eratic as he is slowly being possessed by whatever force lives in the castle. Eventually, he starts chasing his girl and is trying to kill her. She eventually makes it down to some hidden area where the mummified remains of some prince is sitting on a throne. Suddenly, the prince gets up and starts shambling towards her. He’s moving really slow since it’s all practical effects. Turns out he’s the one who has been possessing the guy. The prince was young when he died, I think, and wanted the kid to stay with him. That’s why he got rid of the guys parents. So, she’s being chased by both of them. In the end, she manages to get away and I think she ends up killing her boyfriend in order to escape. Then, the prince sits back on his throne and whispers “Stay,” over and over before it fades to black and the credits roll. Hopefully, someone here has seen it. I honestly think I only saw it the one time, but that mummy prince starting to move freaked me out when I saw it as a kid!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playroom_(film)	Playroom (film)
1039	This movie is in English and in color…pretty sure it is US-made.  It’s from the very late80s-mid90s time and I guess would be though of as a rom-com.  There are no big-name stars in it. Plot is  – a somewhat bored married couple in their mid to late 30s are both pulled in the direction of cheating on each other.  They each find a willing partner. Husband finds a much younger woman, wife funds a slightly younger guy.  But when the time comes to cheat, neither spouse can go through with it. At the spouses’s home, the husband’s spirit is willing but his “flesh” won’t cooperate. At one point he says “I can’t do it . . how about that?”  The wife gets willingly stripped nearly naked by her would-be lover at his place but at the last moment she emphatically but somewhat apologetically tells him “I can’t…I won’t … I mean…I changed my mind…” Anyone know the flick?  Thx.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_Vacations	Separate Vacations
118	It’s a comedy of situations with a lot of hints of black humour. The movie begins showing a man getting off from his word on a Friday evening. He somehow get’s locked out of his appartment and then his comic adventure starts. We follow him through the night where he meets all different kinds of people in shaggy places who make his life miserable while the only thing he craves for is to return to the safety of his home. You kind of feel sorry for this guy but in the end I think that he reevaluates his life and/or way of living. The movie is in english (I thing american but may as well be british), in colour and I had watched it in the cinema circa 2003	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Hours_(film)	After Hours (film)
262	saw this film on DVD as a new release rental, late 90s to early 2000s. I only remember one scene in which the main male character has sex with a woman over the back of a sofa, his wife walks in on them but leaves quietly and drops the man’s Christmas present down the garbage shoot (a box of CDs or DVDs was the gift). I could’ve sworn this movie had Mark Ruffalo and Radha Mitchell in it (as the cheating couple), but searches involving those two turned up nothing familiar… I don’t remember it being a great movie, but the hole in my memory is driving me nuts!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX/XY	XY
601	Okay, I know; dime a dozen. And theres not a ton of differentiation. I watched it probably in 2001-2004 maybe? In color and in English, and it was definitely on VHS. The opening credits were scanning a bunch of makeup pallets and lipsticks and stuff. Now, I’m sort of trying to fill in the blanks here so forgive me, but I believe the main character is an “Average Joe” of sorts and is in love with the popular girl. They somehow end up spending time together. Theres a scene that I vaguely remember where I believe she jokingly invites him to shower with her and she goes ahead and he quietly sneaks into the bathroom and opens op the curtain but when she notices she screams at him to get out and she wasn’t serious. She forgives him and they sort of carry on with the evening. Then she becomes oddly obsessed with him (or obsessed with him rejecting her in the end). I’m not sure what happens here but she ends up (I think drunkenly) sitting in a lawn chair in his front yard screaming at him to go to prom with her.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatever_It_Takes_%282000_film%29	Whatever It Takes %282000 film%29
783	5-4 years ago I watched loads of weird, mindfucking (less or more movies) and recently one of them can’t get off of my mind; I have no idea how I found it, it’s not popular at all – really disturbing one. I remember a few things about it: 1. it was in color and seemed to be made in 80’s or 90’s 2.it was american 3.the action took place in LA (possibly Hollywood) 4.the characters were teenagers, they were wandering around some deserted areas with lots of graffitis and deserted buildings, in one of which there was a club (?) 5.one of the characters younger brother (also teenager) with his girlfriend drove a red cadillack to some hill during the night on one of their dates, I remember  they were really fucked up psychos (can’t remember why, maybe they killed someone) 6.one night the teenagers took the new kid to a party with them (or somewhere else, I remember it was an event witch bunch of people), it was in someplace that looked like a magasine or something, and suddenly the new kid turned into a giant lizard   please help me out, I hope someone has seen it ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_(film)	Nowhere (film)
327	I can’t remember much about this movie. It starts with a pregnant prostitute getting beat buy her pimp. She has a deformed son, he wears a red hoodie I believe.

Movie is in color and English would come on late night on Cinemax	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanger_(film)	Hanger (film)
717	I remember that this movie was not actually about the daughter. I think it was about the mother. She must have been important or planned to something interesting, because I think the daughter’s ex-girlfriend was a reporter who ended up trying to manipulate the daughter into giving away information or something, which is why they broke up. The only thing I really remember is that the daughter was a bit of an adventure-seeker and was out parachuting (or maybe paragliding or something) and didn’t pull the breaks in time or hard enough and ended up hurting her ankle, I guess breaking it. In the end the daughter started dating the cute asian lady-doctor that treated her at hospital.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jane_Austen_Book_Club_(film)	The Jane Austen Book Club (film)
756	There was this movie, and unfortunately I remember very little about it. I remember seeing it at around 2001-2003ish, so it should be a film that was released before that time. It was definitely in English; at least I think so. Also, it was in colour, if that helps. On the VCR cover, all that I remember is a guys face, and blue background, probably the ocean? The only things that I remember are that there was something to do with water, and by this, I mean like an ocean, or maybe it was something like a submarine or an oil rig, and I think that the main character was a guy, who was either a ghost, or a silvery liquid metally alien/liquidy thing, that looks a bit like the T-1000  in Terminator 2. Sorry for the lack of detail, and please help me remember this!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss	The Abyss
632	I saw this movie in 2014 (I think) on a cable channel – I have no idea how old it is, but it seemed old.  It may have been foreign, but I don’t recall subtitles. It was a dark and tragic film.  I remember a little girl (perhaps 12 or 13) had a very sad life until she placed some sort of plant under a bed (hers, her parents, I can’t remember) then things were better.  The plant involved blood of some sort, and had to remain there, lest her situation revert to the dismal existence.  This “idea” was given to her by some sort of spirit or fairy that she befriended in the woods who gave her hope/vision of a beautiful fantasy land where she belonged (as queen???) I think the plant was discovered and destroyed (by the mother??) and, of course, things turned bad for the little girl/family. Somewhere near the end, I recall the little girl running away for her life, but she was caught, by a male (her [step]father??) and I believe was fatally wounded with a knife. At the end, she laid dying on a stone fence or table when her fairy friend appeared and (I think) took her to the enchanted after-life she had dreamed of.  Something like that. It was a bittersweet film that I caught midway through.  I’d love to see it again, but cannot remember the name.  Help please.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%27s_Labyrinth	Pan%27s Labyrinth

In the cave these little white creatures that have human face come out.  I think the face color was either green or red.  I think they were like oompa loompas from chocolate factory.  Also I remember at the end there was an unexpected ending.  The main character I think gets shot and killed.  I remember it was on a bus.

913	So I saw this movie maybe when I was 3 or 4 and this is the only moment I remember from it. So it was live-action. There was a woman and a man alone on a sailboat of some sort and then some intruder came and sneaked up on the woman. Then the man saw the intruder’s shadow through the sail of the boat and then he shot the shadow. Then the intruder somehow caught on fire and fell off the boat and he was floating in the water, dead and on fire. If anyone has any clue, I appreciate it!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Calm_(film)	Dead Calm (film)
795	I watched this movie a long time ago, when I was a kid (it was far from a kid’s movie) around 2007, so details may be partially incorrect. The movie was likely created around this time. I don’t recall the exact premise, the woman seemed to be a former human test subject on the run. I recall a scene where the main character is having a nightmare. In the dream, the woman is curled up inside a blue bubble-shaped container filled with water or other clear liquid. She is unconscious, eyes closed with an oxygen mask on her face. Black tubes/wires surround the bubble. A scientist in a white lab coat is walking around the bubble, examining her.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Extinction	Resident Evil: Extinction
483	I watched the movie on Netflix about a loner guy who spent much of his time looking out the window of his apartment and crushing on one of his neighbors.  She was odd herself and something about a gift that she wore in her hair or perhaps made a dress out of.  Anyway, they start dating and doing things together.  I recall the twist was that she was a killer and when he finally visited her apartment she had either killed someone or planned to kill him.  Sorry, I don’t recall more, but I do remember that I enjoyed the movie and would like to watch it again, just can’t remember the name.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_(film)	Roman (film)
568	I saw this movie back in the 80’s. The only scene I remember is there are hikers going up an icy mountain and one slips and knocks his head off the ice. I don’t know how he doesn’t notice this but below the blood stain is Dracula buried in plain sight. I think he feeds off the blood and re-awakens. I would like to know the name and year-if possible-of this film.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_Has_Risen_from_the_Grave	Dracula Has Risen from the Grave
620	I saw this movie back in the 80’s, it was an older Dracula movie and it may have been in black and white. The only scene I remember is there are hikers going up an icy mountain and one slips and knocks his head off the ice. I don’t know how he doesn’t notice this but where he knocked his head off the ice there is a bit of blood and below the blood stain is Dracula buried in plain sight. I think he feeds off the blood and re-awakens. I would like to know the name and year-if possible-of this film.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_Has_Risen_from_the_Grave	Dracula Has Risen from the Grave
182	I saw parts of this movie a few years ago & searched everywhere but can’t find the name of it.  It was made before 2013 and I only remember a few bits of it.  This movie is similar to “the day after tomorrow”.  In the movie, there is a really bad snow storm and everything freezes.  The people are in a bank in the city and they are burning money to stay warm.  One lady freezes to death and her husband (clearly upset) takes off his coat to run out into the cold weather essentially commiting suicide.  One of the other people try to take the dead womans fur coat but the others do not let him take it.  I remember a couple of them ended up leaving in a vehicle and they came across a few people in the military.  They thought the people in the military were going to help but they were looting and killing others to stay alive.  The people were trying to get to a submarine that was going to take them to a warmer climate.  In the end, they reached the sub.  This may have been a “made-for-tv-movie” because I didn’t recognize any of the actors	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_(1998_film)	Ice (1998 film)
735	Okay, I don’t remember how this movie starts off but I remember the main events that happened. It is a movie and I’m pretty sure I seen it in around 2010-2013 but I’m not sure. So pretty much this is a love story of complications between this married couple, the husband is the one messing up and the wife is the one who keeps putting up with it. He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn’t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife’s love back. (That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom. I believe it was because he had been avoiding her and didn’t want anything to do with her assuming that she had put his through what he had gone. But that might not be correct. I hope that’s enough to the answer of the title of this movie, I remember it and I’ve been trying 1 year to find it and figure it out but I can’t. If you know it or have any possible ideas that will lead me to it, let me know please. Thank you in advanced!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireproof_(film)	Fireproof (film)
744	I’m looking for this movie when the events belong in around 1800s. A man stayed in a hotel on his way to study at an university. However he fell in love with a beautiful woman who was wife of the hotel’s boss old man and he stayed for 2 years in this hotel. He wanted to go with his beloved woman but old man claimed him to pay her all due including living cost, food and clothes. Finally, the woman decided to stay with old man and the man went to study at the university as doctor. At the end of the movie, the man who became a famous doctor recieved a letter. As mentioned in a letter, that beautiful woman waited him until she died. Then the man visited that hotel and he remembered the woman. Could you please tell me name of this movie?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_and_Death	The Girl and Death
259	i remember this film quite well, just not the title. its about a group of high school students who are constantly bullied. at one point the bullies corner 2 guys in the bathroom and break one of their cameras. so they all retaliate by throwing a party, in disguise, and knocking them all out with chemicals in the punch. they all wake up chained up. the main characters are in disguise. the main one has a trench coat and gas mask, a girl has a butterfly mask. and a black kid has a clown suit. at one point the black kid wants to opt out so gas mask guy stabs him and he dies. the way they torture their victims include: making a fat guy chop off a girl’s fingers, using a nail shooter thing (like in no country for old men) on a guy’s leg and face, and putting a slowly working acid on a girl’s face. eventually one of them escapes (a black jock i think) and tries to get help. the cop he finds gets killed and there is a quad chase. when they are found by the cops they kill themselves. the girl they put acid on is seen in a coffee shop, scarred, in the intro and conclusion of the film. her scenes are in black and white. thanks in advance	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_(film)	The Final (film)

172	I watched a weird movie in the ’80’s where the main character wore a strange white helmet with handles throughout the entire movie. I think the helmet with may have been some sort of camera and the guy was filming his life. I also remember that the main character also directed the movie and may have also wrote the script. I remember liking the movie, but for the life of me, I cannot remember what the movie was. I actually watched it several times because it was shown on The Movie Channel a lot in their early days of broadcasting on cable.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Life_(1979_film)	Real Life (1979 film)
802	I hope someone can help me track down this movie. I may have some details mixed up, or combined with another drama, so if you have any suggestions at all, please share them. There is a Caucasian man, who is a little person, who is successful in his working life but is lonely in his private life. He may be a writer or editor, or some such professional. I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it’s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well. If you have any ideas at all, no matter how far fetched, please share them. Thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Starlight	Frankie Starlight
993	The color movie that I believe I saw in the 90s. . The movie was probably made around that time of the nineties as well. I saw it on television. Some friends were traveling from Canada to Louisiana I believe. I believe they were traveling to Louisiana to pick up a friend’s body for a funeral. The movie takes place in Canada with the main character who claims to be Satan, would find some bum on the street and offer him  $5 for his signature as sale of his soul.  There were some good laughs as he was the leader of his terrible neighborhood band. He also had interest in the friends corpse , as  he believed it belongs to him because he had purchased the soul for $5. He  had a bunch of pictures of the souls he had purchased pinned up on his wall. It was not a horror movie at all I guess you would call it dark humor. It may very well have been a Canadian movie I don’t know.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_(film)	Highway 61 (film)
320	So my brother was flipping through channels and stopped on this movie with a nude woman, and a man walking toward the woman slowly. When he gets to a certain point, something slices him in half, and the front half I think slides down the glass or whatever it is slowly. I can’t remember if there were voices or not. It was in color, and this scene was dark. Then my bro switched the channel again and this was about 6-7 years ago maybe. I’ve been trying to remember what it is but no luck. Anything is appreciated, like actors or something. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Ghosts	Thirteen Ghosts
291	Please help me figure this out! It’s been driving me crazy for months. It’s a movie I watched within the past 10-15 years. The only part I remember is the main character (a man who was possibly a writer) was trying to hide his thoughts or memories from a bad guy in a fictional library (?) inside his mind? I remember him running around a circular room pushing files that were his thoughts or memories and trying to lock doors before the bad guy could in to his subconscious. It seems like there was a woman there helping him. That’s all I can remember! I know it’s very vague and I could be a little off on some of the story line, but I’m hoping someone remembers!

426	I saw this movie on TV in the late nineties, and it couldn’t have been more than about 10 years old. A man is involved in something action-y and intense, possibly a car accident, or he may have been shot at. He goes home to what I’m pretty sure is a nice lodge/cabin in a wooded area, and his wife tells him she doesn’t recognize him, that he’s not her husband. he’s convinced his memories are real. the viewer is, at this point, uncertain whether the man or his wife is telling the truth. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see any more of the film,  I’ve been wanting to watch it ever since!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_Man_(TV_series)	Nowhere Man (TV series)
399	I remember two scenes from this horror movie. The first one showed someone walking in a cemetery at night, it was very creepy and I think there was a secret passage there. Then there was a scene in a house. Husband and wife are watching Tv and the man asks his wife to go get him a beer in the kitchen. When she’s there a man shows up behind the fridge and stabs her. Then he kills her husband on the couch. Maybe he murdered the husband first, I’m not sure. After killing them, the man notices their kid (a boy) is standing still watching him on the top of the stairs, and he walks towards the boy. I’m 32 now, and I was a kid when I saw these scenes, so it was like, more 22 years ago. It was in color, and I’m sure it wasn’t a tv series.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightbreed	Nightbreed

1061	I saw this on tv somewhere between 2006 and 2011. In color, English speaking actors. A man lives multiple lives all at the same time. One of which he is an actor. I specifically remember a scene where he is in a car, having a conversation with someone, and believes that to be his reality. Then, in another reality he is an actor doing a voice over or dub of that exact same scene. I think I remember there being an explosion at some point. At the end of the movie a woman explains to him that he isn’t human, he is more or less a god that created that reality and got stuck in it. And that the only way out was to accept his fate to return to his astral form. At the end of the movie he becomes a flash of light. I wish I could remember more details.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nines	The Nines
128	I watched this movie on Netflix of the summer. The man has brown hair & wears glasses. He wakes up with a different life everyday.

494	I saw a movie a long time ago, around 1978, and it was about a man (magician or illusionist) that could make other people see and hear what he wanted them too. In the movie, around the beginning, the movie shows him as a performer doing tricks, then he goes and stays at a mans’ house as a guest, they are having a party to celebrate, drinks are served and people are drinking and eating snacks. The next thing I remember is that he is cutting up carrots for a dish and makes it appear that he cuts off his finger. A lady next to him is screaming and he shows her that it was a carrot that he cut and not his finger. Next I remember a scene where the man is being questioned by someone of authority in a small room. The man totally makes the authority figure believe he sees him float in mid air and he really is just sitting down in a chair smoking or eating something, He does these things with the power of his mind. I cannot remember this movie…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin_(film)	Harlequin (film)
1083	First off the movie is made in English and was filmed in colour,probably made before 2008 but definitely not before 1985 or so. The movie begins with a guy practising his martial arts by watching tapes and copying the moves performed by other fighters next to his caravan. He runs a fuel station though he is very poor as he lives in the desert with his friend who is obsessed with discovering aliens. One night his best friend goes out and tries to find evidence of aliens in a sandstorm using a metal detector. He eventually stumbles across something that drives the detector crazy and starts digging. He gets possessed by a red demon spirit and he kinda like recruits other people by possessing them. At that point an Asian girl is dispatched from Asia to go to him and fight him. Skipping forward I also remember that this Asian girl talks about this specific sword or grip thing that is suppose enhances her power and can kill the demon, which turns out to be on the main characters guitar that his father used to own. Apparently the father picked it out of a meteorite Anyhow, would greatly appreciate if someone told me what movie it is	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Johnny_Tao:_Rock_Around_the_Dragon	Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon
403	-Date: I’m not entirely sure, but I think I watched it on Netflix a year or so ago -Language: I believe it was in either German, French, or English -Where seen: I think on Netflix. It was definitely a movie. -Extras: in color, recently made, setting somewhere in Europe (Germany, France, UK) -Description: A woman wakes up in some secret underground apartment (I can’t remember if she was kidnapped or otherwise ended up there another way). The resident of the apartment is a man who wears a mask and gloves, never taking them off. He makes her breakfast. The apartment is full of art and statues and books, almost museum-like. There’s some fancy mirror somewhere and a scene takes place there. The woman at some point is in a cell where she is tortured every day. The only thing keeping her going is a letter she finds hidden in the wall that’s a first hand account of a previous woman being tortured there. When she escapes she realizes the person holding her captive and torturing her was the masked/gloved man. She’s furious and I think leaves. At some point it becomes known that the masked/gloved man was one of the people experimented on by the Angel of Death (Mengele), a nazi doctor who did experiments on twins, handicapped, elderly. The man was referred to as his cell number, and because of the experiments he developed super immunity to either disease (I think). There was a fire at the place where Mengele did the experiments and the man survived but had burns all over his body hence the mask and gloves. At some point the woman comes back. The police I think are after the masked man. I’m not sure if he gets shot, but they’re in the metro station and at some point the woman puts him (I think he was dying?) on a metro car full of flowers and bombs and sends it off to blow up. I think for some reason I can’t remember there were protests going on in the general public that were taking place at the same time as this metro car explosion.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)	V for Vendetta (film)
810	it was a movie i saw and got from Blockbuster in 2008-2010. it was 3d animated, and since i was a kid, i didn’t really recognize any actors’ voices. the main character was a nerdy inventor kid, who was hated in his hometown. his only friend was a floating robot with a TV screen for a face, who i think was voiced by a lady. he kicks off the movie by going to a fancy futuristic private school with a huge atrium. i don’t remember much about that part of the film, but he got an atomic wedgie at one point, and fell in love with a girl. in order to impress her, he does some weird science and splits his brain into two personalities: the normal, nerdy half, and a cool, greaser half. he switches between the two for a while, before the cool half tries to be the dominant personality. the climax of the movie is a fight between the two personalities inside the main character’s head. that scene is weird and dreamlike. that’s basically all i remember. i know the movie itself wasn’t a dream, because my brother remembers it too. help!!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutty_Professor_(2008_film)	The Nutty Professor (2008 film)
405	I watched this movie on HBO back in the 80’s and I believe it was relatively recent at the time. In color and English. The basic premise of the movie was that a group of scientists found a way to record a person’s experiences (emotion, sight, touch, sound, etc.) onto a tape. A different person viewing the tape would then re-live these experiences as though they were that person. One of the scientists, an elderly woman, is working late one night when she realizes she is beginning to have a massive heart attack. Realizing that she’s about to die, she puts on the headset, records the experience, and is found dead the next morning. Anyone playing her tape proceeds to have a heart attack just like she did. Another scientist manages to isolate just the visual part of the recording so it doesn’t kill him. Playing the tape reveals the woman’s experience after death. After death she leaves her body, re-lives several special moments of her life, then takes a journey through a hellish landscape before arriving at a bright light.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorm_(1983_film)	Brainstorm (1983 film)

Since 20 years I want to see it again but cant find out its name   The movie (in colour) must be older then 1980 A low budget movie. I had the German version since I’m in Switzerland A lonely man with mental handicap is the main actor He gives odd noises from himself He was walking around in the city, at night, empty streets…. A black cat shows up that catches his attention He notices a bar that is still open, bright light from the windows, he hears the jazz music playing inside He enters the bar and stands still all at the entrance He observes the people having fun and listening to a live jazz concert He catches the rhythm and starts to move around and giving out sounds that match the beat oft the music The jazz band notices his participation and invites him on stage He gets the micro and gives out the monotone noise that is linked to his mental illness The audience loves it and he receives loads of applause From that moment I can’t recall the rest oft he movie but he seem to have found sense in life playing jazz and entertaining the audience I think the film ended in that town, he has his own house, a wife and a kid playing in the garden	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Bubby	Bad Boy Bubby
803	I remember a kids adventure/horror movie from the late 90’s-early 2000’s.  Live-action, possibly made-for-TV.  A bunch of kids are chased into a big old spooky mansion (boy, girl, indian boy) by some bully who goes in after them. They find some magical bottle with an Indian head carved into the lid.  They remove the lid, releasing some big demonic monster thing into the house.   The carved bottle lid suddenly starts talking to them, has these weird little legs that he walks around on. One part I distinctively remember is that there’s some homeless guy squatting in one of the bathrooms.  When he opens the door, the monster is there.  When the kids pass by the bathroom, they peek inside and find the homeless guy dismembered with blood splattered everywhere.  The Indian kid runs off to throw up.  The girl is freaked out. I also remember near the end, the Indian kid uses himself as bait, gets killed, but then somehow actually isn’t dead because of some magic bullshit or something, the demon gets put back in the bottle, the bully is now their friend, and they say bye to the Indian bottle guy.  S Soooo… yeah.  Super weird.  Please help me remember what this was called.

323	The genre is sci-fi, action, adventure (but not that much of sci-fi actually). This movie was on TV in the early 80s, so most likely it’s from the 70s. It was a very simple, moderate budget movie without any special effects. It was in color, I think. A young man comes to a provincial seashore town having in his possession a piece of a metallic plate, decorated with strange symbols. As far as I recall they look like Phoenician alphabet. However, this is just a small piece of a bigger artifact, so this guy is looking for the rest of it. I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it’s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning. He said something like: These were parts of an artifact left by extraterrestrials who visited Earth in ancient times, the text on the plates revealed the date of their return. However, I’m not sure whether he was joking or not.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_the_Gods	Search for the Gods
317	So I saw it on tv in the 90’s (I have no idea if it was made for tv or just an old movie playing on cable). There were a group of people researching or maybe just hunting sea snakes. I remember the girl got her period on the boat. There was a scruffy captain looking dude and some cave sex between him and the girl. I have zero memory of the plot line beyond that it’s been bugging me for years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Tide	Dark Tide
390	What is the name of recent film or TV series pilot with woman who can read minds and by the end of the film reluctantly teams up with a policeman. She saves his life from being shot in a building, which was a trap to kill him, but she felt that.

594	Hi, I remember watching part of this mini-series probably in the early 1990’s.  I remember very little about it but the following: The hero was some sort of computer program that had come to life and had somehow gained human form.  He had a sidekick who was actually human but I can’t remember what his job was.  As I recall they were investigating something.  What I remember the most is that the computer guy had an extremely fast car, so fast that you could barely see it when he drove it.  So his sidekick at one point remarked that he was driving dangerously fast, to which the computer guy replied that it was all good because his reflexes were so fast.  To which his sidekick  replied “Maybe you have good reflexes, but all the other drivers are human and don’t have those reflexes” and the computer guy agreed and slowed down. This was definitely in color and I’m thinking it was american in origin, though I suppose it could be Canadian. If anyone can figure this one out, I’d be grateful	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automan	Automan
274	The film is about a man who finds out about a serial killer and the killer tells him he is going to teach the man how to protect a killer. Throughout the movie there are several instances where more and more the man is drawn into helping the killer but at the end it is discovered that the killer was teaching the man how to protect the man’s young daughter, who turns out had killed a neighborhood boy.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duress_(film)	Duress (film)

126	so the movie I saw had monsters. It had color, and was I’m English, I distinctly remember a flying monster kidnap a male teen and kill him then at them end the teens eyes are poked out and the monster is looking threw them. The monster could fly, and green (I think) I think I saw it on TV but I’m not 100% I was fairly young I’m 18 right now so if that gives an indication other than that I think some teens die from a variety of other monsters (but that last part could be a different movie).

367	Only saw the last 10-15 minutes of this film back in the late ’90s or early 2000’s, but the film looked like it might be from the ’80s.  Late night b-movie, definitely in English and color.  Something I stumbled across while channel surfing one  night. All I can remember is a group of 3-4 people in the hills/mountains, running from some very large man/mutant.  Don’t think it was intended to be bigfoot, as I seem to remember it was a giant, bald, deformed man, but who knows.  Someone was hanging over a cliff while others were trying to pull them back up.  The monster catches up to them and throws at least one over the edge, can’t remember what happens to the others.  In short, all but one of the people is killed.  The survivor is a young lady who is abducted by the creature and taken back to his cave.  The closing shot of the movie is a fade on the cave entrance as you hear the sound of a baby crying, implying that the monster fathered a child with the girl. This is one of those cheesy films that I would love to see the rest of.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prey_(1980_film)	The Prey (1980 film)
124	There is a boy who discovers a monster living under his bed, he is frightened but the monster reassures him he is only renting the space under his bed and he will not harm him. Soon, kids at a nearby park begin to go missing and the boy realizes it’s the monster causing this. The boy uses this to his advantage by luring bullies to the park and having the monster dispose of them. Towards the end, the boy is walking home and sees the monster on a swing at the park. When the boy approaches the monster tells him “I’ve relocated” and begins to grin. I watched this on television in the mid 90s, not sure if it was a movie or a tv episode. Any help is appreciated, thank you!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Man	The Shadow Man
930	Remember watching parts of this when i was 8 or 9. I remember it was an older movie most like from the 70s or early 80s. Suspenseful thriller. The one scene i remember in particular is a scene where there is a young woman listening to music laying on the carpet or a couch in the living room. Suddenly she is attacked by an unknown predator but the scene cuts to a different scene. Later her friend / sister (another young woman) comes to the house and is horrified to find her friends decapitated head in the fish tank Other notes – I think the woman who found her friends decapitated head is being stalked by an anonymous figure and he may have followed her to a theme park?   But yes please help me find this movie. Been playing on my mind for ages thank you	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Knows_You're_Alone	He Knows You're Alone

140	There is a movie that I saw approximately in the early 2000s (though I feel as if the movie could possibly be older than that) It was about a young boy who had a mother that was neglectful. I believe he begins a relationship with a neighbor, an older gentleman, who tells the boy stories to entertain him. So basically the boy becomes closer with the older man, than he does with his mother. The mother is always worried about their finances. The old man tells the boy that there are leprechauns that left him gold, and that he has to wait for it. The movie ends with the man giving him the money (I’m not sure if that is quite right but the boy ends up with the money). The old man has to go away. There is a scene where the boy is throwing all the money from his pockets onto the floor in front of his mom saying something like “The leprechauns took him away”. I think the final scene was of the old man in a car driving away. Now I am POSITIVE that this movie is not a fantasy, upbeat type of movie. I saw it when I was about 10, and all the subplot and allusions flew above my head. But the movie did imply that the old man was wanted for something, or was being looked for. Can anyone help me?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_in_Atlantis_(film)	Hearts in Atlantis (film)

277	So, I saw this movie in the early to mid 2000’s (2005?) A friend and I rented it from a movie store, from the horror/thriller section. It was an American movie, color, not sure when it was made, but couldn’t have been before ’98.  I don’t remember any of the actors being well known, and it may have been a direct to DVD deal. I only really remember it was about a young man, early 20’s, who was a murderer. I think he killed /tortured hikers or campers in the woods he lived near(maybe, I may be misremembering that.). I do remember that he was a local boy, had some trouble with the local law, and he wore a leather jacket and boots, either cowboy or motorcycle.  I think he put crushed beer cans or paper in his boots to make him taller. He was a psychopath or sociopath, bad dude, very creepy. His name might have been Ray, or Roy(?). But, I think it was based on a true story. I know that this isn’t much to go on, but it’s been bugging me that I can’t remember anymore than this vague information.  Thanks.    	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_(2006_film)	The Lost (2006 film)
579	There was a movie that I rented and watched like back in 2002. But the movie could’ve been from the 90s. The one scene that I remembered was the there was this little boy of about 7 years old or so, who encounters aliens or some higher beings. And I think his mum was dead because in one scene in a bedroom or something he wished or asked the aliens to bring his mother back for 1 day so that he could celebrate his birthday with her. They granted that wish and his mother got to spend 1 day with him on his birthday. After that the boy said good bye to her and the aliens came and took her away to wherever….  yeah , it sounds pretty weird and I may have not remembered it all to accurately but I hope one of you can tell me what movie this is. It was in English movie. I think the boy was blonde.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence	A.I. Artificial Intelligence

497	So this bugs me for many years now. the Movie is about a sole surviving astronaut who is on Mars and gets rescued. He than has trouble breathing on Earth and soon is in pain, then a finger grows out of his arm or hand, then something more, i think then an whole arm and in the end he just clones himself and the clone attacks a Dr. or so and then dies. The plot is that he injected himself with some mars slime or something to breathe mars air and survive. They first decide to just let him die cause he is dangerous, but in the last moments they decide to send him back to Mars since he can survice there. In the final scene of the Movie you see him skyping or so with his wife, he is in the Mars colony which is populated with many of his clones now working there.   i saw this movie in the late 90´s maybe oo´s it was in german it was on ty, i am not really sure which channel it was in color it was around that time when x-factor (not the crap music show) was extremely popular in germany	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joining_(The_Outer_Limits)	The Joining (The Outer Limits)
198	I watched a part of this movie when I was very young, probadly in the late 90’s or early 00’s. It was a colour movie, and the actors spoke english. I saw it on the TV and am pretty sure it was a movie. I only remember two scenes: – the lead character (or one of them) is getting a blowjob by a rollerskating girl – this is in the middle or end of the movie. – another character shoots at his wife/girlfriend whilst in bed with a man, when he discovers she is cheating on him. In an earlier scene we see her cheat on him as well, where he also discovers it. I remember the plot being about a young boy, that due to certain “talents” becomes an pornactor, and is given the name Dick. But I’m not entirely sure.   Hope you can help.

835	I saw this movie either in the 90s or early 2000s on TV; I think on Disneychannel? I can’t quite remember the time, but the movie in my head looks like it would have been made in the 90s or even late 80s. I think the plot was that the main character was unpopular in high school so she makes a wish to become popular and her life the next day is switched. She is popular all of a sudden and is dating the hottest guy in school, but it is all fake and she doesn’t want it? The scenes I remember are the opening, she is dancing very dramatically to the opening music with a red sash flying in the air around her I think? Also, I remember the scene where she lives her first “popular girl” day and she is in a field with tall grass and is looking for her crush or current boyfriend and is chasing him in that tall grass very dramatically. I think the person who granted her wish was some lady who was a shop keeper or fortune teller or something. These are all just small facts that I think I remember but I only can vividly see those two scenes in my head. Help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Witch	Teen Witch

848	I remember this horror movie from late 70s early 80s. I think it was based in the woods in a house close to a river or the river may actually run under part of the house. Someone kills anyone that comes near the house. I remember close to the end a teenager girl finds what I believe was a boy locked in a dark room with the mirrors covered.  She tries to help the boy by taking the cover off the mirror so he can see himself (I don’t think she even saw his face at this point).  When he turns to the mirror she screams and I think runs out but someone catches her and kills her (not sure if it was the deformed boy) I think the killer might have been a woman like maybe the mother.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena_(film)	Phenomena (film)

In heaven he learns that reincarnation exists and that they are given a shot to have them forget about their past lives. He somehow avoids taking the shot because he wants to find his fiancé. So, he is reincarnated as a baby. As he grows up, he remembers everything and goes to find her. So now he’s a teenager and finds his woman. I can’t remember anything after that.

They eventually wait for the robber to die but he doesn’t and then one teen kills the robber and they bury him in a park. They throw the gun in the trunk of the car and push the car into the gravel pit lake to hide it. Years later they meet up again as adults in a cabin.

691	Hi, I’ve been trying to find a movie that I saw years ago. I have little information to go on, I can’t remember any famous actors being it, but it was about a group of people all living their own lives. I think one the main people was crippled or walking with the aid of a stick. I can’t excactly remember the details of the story but I remember some specific scenes. One in particular where a person (I think a woman, one of the main characters in the movie) is in a car on a bridge. And these strange ripples appear making the bridge disappear bit by bit and causing her to fall into the water. And then a few second later the bridge reappears again piece by piece. Then there is a scene where the main protagonists get together and find out where those ripples come from and apparently they come from somewhere in the middle of an ocean or sea. They try to go their on a boat before it is too late (they have limited time from what I can remember, before the next ripple comes) and then they arrive at this sort of facility in the middle of the sea and they go inside and find out tue government or military (I’m not sure) is creating the ripples and the boss there explains everything. I’m not sure what happens next but in the end they all are back at home and their lives are better. If not mistaken, the man with the stick can walk without the stick and a woman gets back together with her boyfriend I think? If anyone knows the title of this movie, please let me know!

950	I’m not sure if this is even a movie, a tv show, or if I dreamt it or imagined it. The scene that I most vividly remember is where two teenage/early 20s girls knock on the door of an elderly couple, the couple lets them in and while the couple is asleep, the girls brutally murder them and then proceed to have sex while in the same bloodied bed as the murdered old couple. Another scene is where one girl is in the shower, drinking beer, and the other girl joins her and the have sex in the shower. Another scene which I’m not sure if it’s even part of the movie or not, the girls break in to an old lady’s trailer home and molest her, wear her underwear, and then a cop finds them and kills them. Not sure if that last scene is correct at all.

782	As a kid (probably about 16 years ago I’d guess?) I used to force my parents to check out this movie from the library whenever it was available. It was about these different groups, each of a different color, and they were all enemies…they “fought” by throwing paint of their own color on one another. I think there were tribes for each primary color, and then black and white… And I’m pretty sure it took place in space. The movie was in color, but it was definitely an older film. Kind of campy I guess. I can’t find anything on Google.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_War	Rainbow War
125	So this may be a tricky one. I remember having watched this film (highly possible that it was a miniseries) when I was a kid, I am 24 now and I believe I was under the age of 10 when I watched this. I remember watching it on the TV, it was in color, and the actors used English. Based on the graphics I would say that the feature came out sometime after 1980. Here are the snapshot scenes that I remember: A white woman (middle age) is shot in the knee by an arrow during an attack by Native Americans, she is then approached by a Native American who wraps some sort of beaded leather around her injured knee. Another scene: a woman desperately clings to and cries in agony as her dead baby is taken away in a carriage (maybe a sled). Another scene: a woman (think she was Asian) and a man (African American) are surrounded by a group of outlaws?, the outlaws stab the man ( I think he was stabbed in the armpit/rib area. The Asian woman is then hung by the outlaws, she was wearing a red dress. I also remember the woman who was shot in the knee living in a house with other women, one of whom has a baby. Woman with the baby considers shooting her child during the Native American attack to spare her child from capture or a more gruesome death. At another point, the slaves or servants (I don’t know if they were slaves but I do remember that they were African American) are hung by the Native Americans (though its possible that someone else hung the slaves. I really hope someone can help identify this movie/miniseries, I’ve read through dozens of descriptions of Westerns and nothing seems to quite fit. My mother, who also watched this, remembers the scenes I described but the not the name of the feature.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Women	True Women
842	The movie starts out with a chalk outline on a sidewalk where someone had fallen off a roof on fire or some other means. The main character was a woman who became close to a teenage girl she was either the case worker on or the cop investigating the girl’s case. Or, she might have been the girl’s relative. The main character meets another woman who has abilities/powers that she gained from sacrificing the person who was dead at the start of the movie. She teaches the main character to explore her abilities. I think the main character had to drink something to get these powers. One particular scene I remember is that the main character came home to find her apartment crawling with giant bugs of all shapes and sizes. I think they had something to do with the source of her power. In the end, the guru woman told the main character she had to sacrifice the girl or the fire that consumed the person in the beginning would kill her. The main character’s fingers started to entwine and caught fire when she refused to kill the girl. She then plunged her burning fingers into the stomach of the guru and sacrificed her instead of the girl.

135	OK. So I think I saw this movie on lifetime. It’s from the 2000/2015. All I remember is a wealthy business man marrying a young realeaste woman. Then for some business reason he travels a lot to England. They are building a beautiful big mansion and the wife gets in a relationship with one of the construction guy and tries to kill her husband. Can’t remember if they actually do kill him or not.

353	Okay, this is driving me nuts… All I remember (correctly I hope) is that it was a movie maybe 70’s comprised of a number of unrelated scenes all set in Europe… England or France. The two sketches I think I remember are: One with a group of prostitutes standing along a river in a Parisian looking place wearing furs chatting about life waiting for someone to come pick them up. I think I remember one of them getting picked up, going with the guy to an alley and like… convincing him to pay her without her really having to do much? And then he gives her a ride back to the side of the road with the other gal (gals). The other sketch (and I could have sworn it was Peter Sellars, but I don’t see it on his IMDB) is a man and woman walking in the snow with a large funeral procession but they’re hanging back just talking to each other about life and maybe not knowing the guy who died very well? They’re being irreverent and people give them looks and they just continue to hang back further in the crowd. I believe the movie was a comedy, but a dry comedy. Can anyone help?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_Times_Seven	Woman Times Seven

All I remember is the older cousin ends up stabbed to death in an alley and at the end it’s revealed that the younger cousin sees the older cousin kissing someone so the young cousin stabs the older cousin to death.

524	Movie girl gets kidnapped and sold for sex then gets buried in trunk that falls through to a sewer below and get revenge? What was the name of that English speaking movie maybe probably in the last 5 years or so where a girl is doing a modeling photo shoot and the photographer and I think his friend shows up at her place and kidnap her? She finds herself in a dirt basement handcuffed to a pole or something and sold for sex to strangers. After escaping for a brief time she realizes she’s in a foreign country half way around the world and someone who she didn’t know was in on it takes her back at the house where they dig a hole and bury her in a big trunk under the dirt of that same basement. Then the trunk ends up falling through to an underground sewer that the bad guys had no idea was down there when they buried her. She finds her way to a staircase that leads to a church and the priest helps her with food, but doesn’t know what’s really going on. Then she takes revenge out on the bad guys one by one and kills them gruesomely.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Spit_on_Your_Grave_2	I Spit on Your Grave 2
514	okay so not much to go off of here but i remember seeing a scene in a movie my parents were watching where a guy basically freaks out when he sees a sprinkler running. i think he even snatched up the girl who was near it or at least pushed her away from it. the reasoning was a flashback where blood was being washed off by the sprinkler. sorry for the little amount i could tell you but thank you to those who can figure it out	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-PAX_(film)	K-PAX (film)
301	I look for a movie in which everything goes wrong. There are a lot of movies like this , but this one is champion . Literally every 3-5 minutes something bad happens , making the life of the main heroes worse , and ultimately the movie does not have happy ending. It’s not tragedy or comedy , it’s quite normal movie actually. It was about two men and one blonde woman living in house , maybe somewhere in the suburbs. In the begging everything looks fine , around the 15-20 minute the things start to go wrong , with little stuff like somebody breaking his hand. Accidentally the two guys kill the woman , put her in trunk , and later bury the body in someones backyard , and if I remember right someone find it. If I am not wrong also included planned wedding and trip to Las Vegas. In the end one of the guys was alive but the police probably charged him. I watched it 10 years ago.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Bad_Things	Very Bad Things
516	The movie focused around a single father and his daughter. The daughter was gonna perform at a school show and wanted the father to perform with her, but he was having problems and didn’t know if he could make it. Ya know you’re usual plot. But in the end of the movie he was able to make it to the performance and started singing and acting what I think was a Sweeney Todd musical or something really similar to it cause the play ended with one of them cutting the throat of an old man. everyone was shocked but they clapped cause this very young girl decided to do a dark play. there were also 3 old men who were like friends of the father or related to him or something. They were probably in their 60s. They were in the play too and helping the girl practice for her play. I think the dad had a love interest but I doubt it since the story revolved around the growing bond between the father and daughter. They were having familial trouble because the mom divorced or moved away or died or something (I think. I only really remember the ending with the play.)	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Girl_(2004_film)	Jersey Girl (2004 film)

My earliest drive-in movie memory is of this scene where a man sticks a diamond pin into a woman’s body after killing her. The woman may have been topless and she may have been killed by being strangled, but I’m less sure of that. The shot of the pin going in her body was an extreme closeup.

376	I remember sneaking into my living room at night once I was like in 5th grade maybe so around 2006. I saw this scene and it looked more or less like a music video. there was this woman with white hair I think and she was in the woods throwing things into this hole in the ground and it was filled with bugs, whatever she threw in the bugs would devour it, like one time she threw in an iguana or something and the bugs ate it to the bone. at the end of the scene she fell into the hole. i know this is a site for movies but this is my last hope I’ve tried everything to track this down please someone help me. also I think it was on and indie music channel or it might have been a hard rock/metal song, I don’t know any pop songs that have such weird surreal music videos.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_and_Powerless	Weak and Powerless
104	Maybe it was a series on PBS or a movie I saw on TV it was in color I saw it early 80’s about a boy who talked about a family member who fought in the war. He was usually wearing an english schoolboy uniform he was anywhere from 7 to 12 years old blonde hair, It was a story about his life I think they called him Duckworth or something with duck in it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%27tang,_Yang,_Kipperbang	P%27tang, Yang, Kipperbang

I remember that in the school there was a rule that if a student did something wrong he had to fight the two senior student and usually the two older student beat the poor student who had to fight them.but one time the main character fights the two and defeats them. He also had a friend that fought the two guys and lost and left the school but I think they met again in the end of the film. in another scene the main character was tied to the ground in the cold weather at night by the other students and left there.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_(2003_film)	Evil (2003 film)
821	Okay so I watched a film a few years ago on tv and the plot was very similar to You’re Next (2011) or I might be mistaken and they might have been the same film but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t the same film. The movie looked like it was made between the late 90s to mid 2000s. It was in english, in colour, and it felt like a made for tv film or direct to dvd. What I remember from the plot is this rich guy and his girlfriend (or fiancee or wife) going to his family house somewhere secluded, the car might have been a red convertible. Then of course there’s the tension between all the family members and they get killed of one after the other until only the girlfriend is left and she drives off in the car at the end.

462	My wife and I are trying to figure out a old move that she always turn on channel surfing and never seen from the beginning . Here is what e have been able to put together…. My wife seems to think that she watched it while she was still in high school so it would of been on t.v. late 80’s early 90’s. From the scenes that she has been able to explain is sounds like the typical 80’s coming of age movie,  possibly  set  in a earlier time frame like the 50-60’s . Here are a couple of plot memory’s that will hopefully shed some light on this movie and put this agony to rest. In the beginning….young female charter is maybe in high school or just graduated, and come from a upper class family.  The charter is a aspiring singer/ performer that has very conservative and classical  style  ( my wife isn’t sure if it a opera style voice,  or Broadway musical but something viewed as classical ) after a early performance the family goes to a celebratory dinner at a nice restaurant or country club.   While at the dinner the female charter meet some other kids that are more rebellious and or from  a different social class.  Throughout the movie the main young female has a awaking and coming of age, and the usual teenage angst that insure within the family dynamic. The last thing my wife remembers is toward the end of the movie or possibly the last scene The Young main charter is showing one of her friends this new type of hip music… (my wife is fairly certain it is Bob Dylan ) that is cool and embody’s the voice of a generation I know it not much to go on but anyone that can help, this will solve a nagging problem that has occupied hours of looking up films that Dylan songs were used in, and there seems not to be a end to this list.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_In_Crowd_(1988_film)	The In Crowd (1988 film)
914	Hello    i am looking for the name of an old movie ( ’70s ) where a hospital performs human experiments with animals. i remember a scene where the main character wakes up next another bed and hears crying. when the man removes the bedcover he sees a body of a pig with a human head. Does anybody knows the name of this movie ? Greetings Marc	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Lucky_Man!	O Lucky Man!
1085	I remember a movie where a couple first got together and started having sex as much as possible; There was a scene with them making love in a bathtub. The boy ended up cheating on the girl and used the last of his condoms on this new girl. The girlfriend came home afterwards and wanted to make love. The boy tried to explain that there were no condoms left, but she remembered there was one left and proceeded to get into position. The boy didn’t know what to do, so he put on the used condom from earlier and tried to proceed, but the girl noticed and stopped him. The movie ends with the couple not ending up together as she walks away from him in an airport. I saw this movie on tv approximately in the early 2000’s. It was in English and in color.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rachel_Papers	The Rachel Papers
1028	I remember seeing something on tv quite a while ago (I can’t remember if it was a movie or show) where this person has the ability to see the deaths of anyone he touches.

637	Okay… I have a really weird movie memory! This was definitely a Rated R or NR movie as there were lots of relations going on… Beware!! I watched this movie on the IFC channel (cable) in 2007 or 2008. It was in color and in English. One memory – an opening scene shows a guy in the shower pleasuring himself and his mom interrupts him by knocking on the door… Another memory… a brother and a sister both having relations with their partners in different cars, and the brother is screaming “mommy” while the sister is screaming “daddy”… yes I know this sounds weird, believe me! Aren’t all IFC movies weird?! And yet another memory involving weird relations… a young girl with an older guy who is making out with her armpit… And finally, the last memory I have and the most important one I think, is that in the ending scene, someone turns into a giant lizard or some kind of alien and climbs out the window… or something!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_(film)	Nowhere (film)
777	Hey I’ve been trying to look for this movie i watched a few years ago but i can’t find it. I watched about just the second half of the movie and i think it was in another language. It was a movie about parents and their kid and how the dad died. The dad died from getting impaled from the back of his head with a straight metal object. He was stuck impaled to the ground until the paramedics came. They tried cutting the metal with a chainsaw? (i don’t remember what they were cutting it with) but they came to a conclusion that the vibration from cutting it would cause him to die. They got him out somehow, don’t remember how he got out but unfortunately he died. The mom and child were devastated. At the end of the movie a guy offered them lots of money if he can share the story on media or something (i also don’t remember much about what the guy wanted so the media thing was just a guess) but the mom turned him down. The movie ended from there with the mom and child walking away from the guy. If anyone can help me find the movie i would appreciate it alot.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Luck_Would_Have_It	As Luck Would Have It

448	Help. I watched this movie on Netflix 7-8 years ago. It was a strangely romantic movie where a guy falls in love with a girl, is devastated when she dies, so he takes a trip with her dead body and still talks to her as if she were alive. Very colorful film. The couple seemed to be in their early 20’s. It’s not Dead Leaves, I’ve seen it and it’s not it. Help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_(2008_film)	Camille (2008 film)
998	I remember watching this movie in the late 90’s early 00’s and i believe it came out in the 90’s, as far as i remember there are a few kids being chased by a demon or creature of sorts in a construction building. I believe the ending was with one of the kids banishing the demon/creature with either pig latin or a spell of sorts.

106	It was like 3am and I was around 9 years old. I don’t remember what channel, but I remember this movie changed my thought process for 2 months, because it freaked me out so much. It was live action. It had these kids who’s mom was stolen by aliens (I think?) that looked human, but not at the same time. The only scene I remember from this movie was where the ruler of the aliens gave the mom some sort of serum to make her fall in love with the first thing she looks at. When he gives it to her, she acts like she fell in love with him and nearly makes out with him, but then kicks him and runs. Then somehow she was given the serum again and she happened to be looking at the dad, and she was in love with him. Something else I remember about that scene was the color purple, just the alien ship that they were in, was purple. Why? I don’t know. It looked like it would of been made by the same people who made Spy Kids to be honest.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_and_Dad_Save_the_World	Mom and Dad Save the World

176	I believe I saw this movie about 5 years ago (2010), in English, not sure if it was on TV or not but I’m certain it wasn’t a show. It was in color. As for the plot, the beginning scene involved the character who I believe is unemployed. He sees a commercial on TV I think for a “get rich quick” method or some sort of advertisement and he calls the number (and maybe gets his friends together.) Ultimately, they end up fixing up a mall or it at the very least takes place at an abandoned mall.  Sorry for being so vague, in fact I don’t even remember if the genre was comedy or horror, or possible a horror comedy.

801	I just remember that the realtor is telling the couple horror stories of the houses he is trying to sell. In one of the houses I believe there was a little girl that had a monkey that ended up killing her family. Upon hearing the story the couple decide they don’t want the house, the realtor shows them another house and the couple love it. Its a big house with a pool, but the husband asks why its so cheap and so the realtor tells him the story. A young guy lived there with his parents who were ever there and the young guy started having visions of a killer that wore a grandma mask when he killed his victims. Those visions became true and he finally went to a therapist i guess to talk about it. In the end he tells the therapist that he is actually there because he had a vision she was gonna get killed. Therapist gets scared, runs off and gets killed by the grandma killer. I think the kid gets killed as well. After the realtor finishes the story the couple refuse to look at any other houses and the realtor gets desperate and stabs the husband on the neck with the house key. The wife runs and tries to get a neighbor to help but she realizes that the whole neighborhood is messed up. I haven’t found this movie and I really wanna know what it is. I think I saw it in the early 2000’s? Maybe mid 2000’s?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_Tract	Terror Tract

201	So this movie has been really difficult to figure out for me, I THINK I found it once like five years ago, but I’ve been through several laptops and never backed it up (I don’t think I even bookmarked the page anyway)! I never saw the entire movie, I actually walked in on my mom watching it in the middle of the night when I was a kid. Think it might have been around 2002 if I’m remembering correctly, since we lived in a lot of different apartments and I think both this movie and seeing the MJ Blanket incident on the news happened in the same apartment. Rough estimate. Anyway I saw presumably the beginning of the movie. It took place in a pretty old time iirc, maybe in Italy just going off of the architecture and clothing the man was wearing and I think he might have been in some kind of really old-looking art studio. He opened this old box and pulled out this big ball, kind of like a crystal ball but completely opaque white (or maybe kind of marbled). Something happened with the ball and it kind of…swallowed his arm? And started changing shape a bit when it did. I don’t remember what happened before that moment or what happened immediately after, but he died (or maybe his friend, I think he had a friend) and these two women emerged from the ball or were awakened BY the ball, and they were covered in these really thin, see-through cloaks that looked like they were made of cobwebs. I think one of them was blonde, and then they left the ”studio” and started walking down the street, still only wearing the robes. Anyway I think it was turned off and I was put back to bed. I think it might have been on the Sci Fi channel and they have SO MANY original movies that I can’t find this specific one, if it even was a Sci Fi original. Any help is appreciated!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sinner_(film)	Saint Sinner (film)
373	This is a movie I barely remember watching when I was visiting my dad. I believe it was a movie made for TV. I was about 7 or 8 years old at the time. I think it was made in the 90’s and it was in color. Even though the movie took place in India or some place like that, it was in English. The only scene I remember vividly is a scene where some guy wearing a turban says a prayer to a gold statue of a giant cobra. The statue comes to life and says something intimidating. The turban guy’s bodyguard (a bald guy wearing an eye patch) shoots at the gold cobra with a rifle, but gets eaten. The Cobra then turns the turban guy into a pig. The other thing I remember about this is the main character. He looked similar to Tarzan, but he wore pants and had some kind of weapon strapped across his back.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Boy_%281998_film%29	Jungle Boy %281998 film%29
742	All I remember is that within the movie they created some backpack like device that makes people stronger and faster with an effect of the persons voice sounding different while using it. Scene wise, I remember one where the “bad guys” are controlling the main character’s(a teenager I think) dad by having him where one of the backpack devices while the person controlling him has some kind of special outfit on so that whatever the controller does the father is forced to mimic. Also, I remember a scene where the main character is on his bicycle on the interstate while wearing one of the backpack devices and he uses it to petal so that he is going like 70mph or something. I would have seen it somewhere between 5-15 years ago though I have no idea how old it was at the time I saw it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.U.N.K.S.	P.U.N.K.S.

It was this young man who comes to live with his aunt (or his uncle’s wife idk), He’s cold blooded, I think he was a psychopath, and he starts fancying his aunt and murders a man who bothered her (or maybe he was covering for her, not sure) and the only scene I remember clearly is that he beat the lie detector that the police made him take.

185	I only saw the trailer, sometime in the last five years. I really wanted to see it. I don’t remember that many details: Definitely remember subtitles, possibly partly English (or English v/o narration). Took place in a remote mysterious ‘boggy’ town in a country like Iceland or Scotland. (“The ground seeps”) At one point there’s a montage of people saying the name of the town and even a cat ‘says’ the name of the town. The name sounded like a cat meowing, and was something like “Moine” or “Majrn”. There was a quick shot of two (maybe brothers?) guys who look similar, and one guy leans to reveal the other in the same pose directly behind him. It reminds me of the two mustached cops with the same name in “Hot Fuzz”. I can’t remember the plot, but the main character might have been a cop or detective come to the town to investigate something, I feel like he had a crummy red car though. Please Help!

1084	Hey folks, Any help would be appreciated. Today we were talking about horror movies and my wife and sister-in-law instantly remembered a movie from when they were much younger. The only problem is they don’t remember much about it at all and it’s driving ME crazy more than it is them. So here goes…  They remember watching this in the late 80s or early to mid 90s. Opens with 4 to 6 people (couples?) in an older car driving down a road when they come across the front panel of a house in or on the edge of the woods. It is only the front of the house. They can clearly walk around the side and see that the rest of the house isn’t there. When they open the door it opens to what looks like an abandoned/rundown/spooky house. It’s a horror movie and the house or something within seems to be playing tricks on them as things keep disappearing. There is some sort of supernatural ghostly/zombie/other scary thing(s) there because the characters end up hiding in a room while this “thing” is trying to get in. Movie closes with them driving away in the same car. *Made in the 80s or early 90s and set in the same time.  IDK how it is that they remember the movie at all with so little detail, but they claim it was something that came on TV often and was a made for TV movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Wind	Demon Wind

And a boy who just started working there and has a little bit of a feminine side. The owner of the restaurant is a very good man who marries his love of highschool at the end.

1064	Hi everyone, I am looking for the following movie. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 1980’s movie. Probably 1983-1986 based on characters wardrobe. Plot revolved around a guy who was stuck/ lost in Brooklyn (?) after dark. He had returned to a bar or club to collect his wallet or something and was left stranded by the taxi. He bumped into a girl who knew him but he couldn’t remember her and she refused to tell him how they knew each other. They wandered around looking for a taxi together but kept coming back to the same spot. Strange things happened and maybe there were vampires(?). The girl wore a top and her strap kept falling down.

218	The movie is about a boy who lives in a post-ecological catastrophe world, where the sun is really intense and anyone spending time outside gets burned. I remember the boy being a (kick?)boxer at the school gym, some parts of the movie are about him getting bullied by the competition, at some point they tie him up in the sun and he barely survives. He dates a girl from school, but I don’t really remember anything else about that. His father is some sort of insane scientist who is looking for a solution to the sun problem, and progressively turns his house into a swamp/jungle and himself /the father) into a plant monster, who ends up attacking the bullies when they follow the boy home. In the end the boy and the girl are immune to the sun. I think I watched the movie on TV in the late 90s or the really early 2000s, and it had a B quality feel to it. I already searched by keywords on most sites that offer movie identification, but found nothing. I expected the title to be “Green” or “Growth” or “Spore” or something in that vein, and there are movies with those titles on IMDB, but none of those is the right one. Thanks to anyone who can help!

570	Hi All, I’m after a movie title that’s been on my mind for weeks now. This movie is a crime/drama from the 1990s or very early 2000s in which a teenage girl is found dead on the outskirts of a little town in a bushy/woods area in a canal where there is a concrete built part with no or few water in it or something. She may not have been the first victim, I can’t remember properly but there was I think two detectives from elsewhere (maybe FBI?) who start to investigate. I think the girl went out the night before in a red, small car and I think her father was not happy that she is going out.. the father is a well known man in the town (maybe a cop or sheriff?). When the girl is discovered  the father is approaching the crime scene and the daughter’s red car is shown, door opened and when the father recognizes the car it’s the people around who need to hold him down as he gets mad and wants to see the girl found dead but they don’t allow him to go there. And I’m not sure but there might be three brothers who are like thugs in the town with bad reputation and the girl’s father runs out to find the killer with the brothers’ help but the two detectives are not happy about it. One of the detectives is young, laid back kinda like Kevin Bacon or Gary Sinise but looking through their filmography I could not find the movie. The other detective may be older(?) and more experienced and might be of different ethnicity too but I’m not sure. If it rings the bell to anyone, please help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_River_(film)	Mystic River (film)

633	+ I saw it around 2006-2010, so it must be made before 2010. + It likely from China/Hong Kong/Taiwan + Plot: The father was impulsive and idling without doing any work, he destroyed the family. His wife married to another man and his son, who was with him, is forced to live a life to shun from the creditors. The father raised the son in the way he thought was the best for him, yet when the two was helpless, the son stole a watch from his classmate’s home for tempura resolution – and this marked the beginning of his life as a theft. When the son was finally caught, the father left him alone. The reunion was in the jail cell, where the son loosed his temper, bit the father’s ear while crying. This was when the father realized how much his son had suffered, the pain, despair, and resentment. The son grew up deciding not to be anyone like his father. He went back to return the first watch he’d stolen, at the same time thinking of the good old times with his father. Knowing his father was still alive, he looked from afar at the old man who once bought him endless suffer, but also the childhood memory, when they were both on the same bike, and he leaned against his father’s back, singing along the way and picking wild flowers.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_This_Our_Exile	After This Our Exile
815	Hey there, I am looking for a movie of a given description: Movie plot was presenting a story of a pair: man and a woman, who were traveling at late sunset and night on a freeway. They had an accident and have hit someone. Then they decided to bury the body in the bushes aside of a freeway. There were also scenes at a freeway restroom: a pair sitting out side on a table and in the car, flickering streetlight with a swarm of bugs. There might been a thing that cops have found a watch maybe? Then the police got in the plot and the pair decided to unbury the body but when they went back the body was gone. It might be important that thier car lights were lighting that area. Then the man was running away from the cops. There was a car chase and finally a man had a car crash. His body was throwed away from the car and he suffered multiple damage to his skin since he was sliding on the asphalt. His body was disfigured but he was still alive. Any way he looked like a bloody mess. Most important clue is that after his car crash he was walking down the road for a bit and then suddenly he was hit by a same car as he owned.  Shockingly the people who hit the man were revealed to be the same pair from the begining. So the whole idea of the movie was some sort strange time loop. So: pair hits someone then that someone appears to be the man from the pair Whole story takes place at desert highway and at night. Also the movie was described as “noir” but was done probably after 2005 it was done with real life actors but had strong comic-ish design. It was in English, probably produced in USA. It was in color. Main actors were in thier late 20s early 30s. Car might been kinda vintage.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Country	Dark Country
716	Live action movie set in America in full English, color film, most likely 80s or early 90s. I saw it on TV (could possibly be a made-for-TV-movie), maybe on a network station sometime between 1990-1995, most likely 1993 (I would only be 9 years old then) in Chicago suburbs. It was a late-night broadcast, between 8pm-midnight. This may have been part of a horror anthology movie. I remember the first scene below more than the second scene. They may not be part of the same movie, though. It’s been a while.  First scene: A classic 80’s nerd (probably thick, black-rimmmed glasses, white t-shirt or collared shirt) is playing a video game in a home bedroom or office. The video game is Space Invaders/Galaga/Galaxian-like (black space background, ship at the bottom of the screen firing lasers at aliens above) on an Atari 2600-like machine (it could just be an 80’s computer, but the joystick was Atari 2600-ish). He’s very focused on his game and is eating oreos or some other junk food regularly. Without his noticing, tentacle-like computer/electrical wires (these may have been corrugated, flexible, metal wire tubes, pictured below) start to slip out of the computer/video game console. It’s like the wires are alive or their being controlled by a poltergeist. A few cuts of the camera show the wires snake slowly along the desk as they move towards the nerd. While this is happening, other events similar to the first scene may be happening, with the movie cutting back and forth between the nerd and those scenes. After a few cuts back-and-forth, some of the wires reach the nerds right or left hand, which is possibly resting by cookies or some junk food. The wires seem to disappear under his hand/arm, like they’re digging into or merging into his wrist. At this point, the nerd has taken notice and is becoming very distraught by the wires, but he doesn’t make any move to escape, possibly because he’s scared stiff. A few more first-scene-like cuts happen, sometimes coming back for a second or two to show the nerd being very distraught. Finally, the nerd is shown again. A split second later, his head pops off, showing wires coming up out of his neck, possibly indicating that the wires took over his whole body and killed him in the process.   Second scene (or another part of a horror anthology or a different movie entirely?) A teenage boy (vampire?) is with a teenage girl, possibly somewhere in a high school in front of a mirror. The girl is in front of the mirror with the boy behind her. The boy fixates on her neck/shoulder area while the girl looks at him quizzically in the mirror. The boy possibly draws his (sharp?) fingers along her skin, maybe drawing blood, before the scene switches to a closeup of a school yearbook page showing the girl’s picture. A hand (probably the boy’s) draws an X on her picture, possibly in blood, indicating that she has probably been killed. This same type of event is repeated a few times with different people: the boy is shown together with someone, then subsequently draws an X on their yearbook picture.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_High_(1989_film)	Monster High (1989 film)
1067	Horror movie on netflix where a boy and girl I believe is a couple, stay at a house that is evil, and controls your actions by playing mind ticks of some sort, I remember they had to set an alarm to remember to hydrate themselves because the time perception was different in the house…there was  murder scene at the end of the movie where the boy accidently kills his girlfriend in a wooden trap that was set for the evil house, before she died she actually called 911, they showed up right after he killed her and was arrested, the end scene was him being carried away in the cop car staring at the house	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_(film)	Oculus (film)
960	So about 2-4 years ago I watched a drama movie on Netflix. I remember that it featured at first (main character) and his girlfriend/wife, and she kills herself by tying a belt to a door and he opens it. It then cuts to a year or two later, when it’s the anniversary of her suicide. (main character)’s friends take him to a lodge to try to cheer him up. The parents of his dead girlfriend/wife blame him for the death. There’s also a whole scene just about strippers. I think the name of the movie was the main characters name, and the art for it was his silhouette by a pool, mostly blue.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshy_(film)	Joshy (film)
142	There is a movie I watched when I was between the ages of 10-13, that was about a kid that helped these kangaroos or atleast what I thought were kangaroos cause they looked like the. He was helping to save their world I think. It starts off that this kid has to do some kind of I guess test you call it to be able to hang out with the “cool kids” at school. He has to cross a pipe that is over a whirlpool and put his name on the wall. I think it shows him falling in and then him helping out these ninja Kangaroos but then it goes back to him deciding on if he should cross and it’s like he never fell into the whirlpool and decides not to cross the pipe.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_of_Virtue	Warriors of Virtue
836	I was young when i saw it maybe 6 and it was in the year of 95. The movie was in color  and it was in english. The only thing i remember is on the cover there is a huge fat guy who plays a demon in the movie and he has a snake that he keeps as his pet around his waist. There are maybe 6 characters on the cover and all I remember of the movie is a part when the main character who is human is taking to that demon guy and their on a stair case and the walls look like a bee hive or what honeycombs look like i know its from before i was born which was 89 so i think it may be from the 80s.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightbreed	Nightbreed
686	I am looking for a Movie and only remember a few details. A daughter comes home from I believe college unexpectedly to her parents house. The police come by asking if she knows anything about a recent murder at the campus. The father goes to the campus and commits a murder just like the first one, while his daughter is at home, to get his daughter off the hook for the murder. I remember one part where the father uses a piece of metal to unlock the chain on the inside of the door to get in. Please help me! I don’t think this movie is very old, late 90’s or 2000’s probably.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Brooks	Mr. Brooks
959	Hi, I only saw the very beginning of this movie (first ten minutes) back in 2013 on YouTube. It was one of those cheap (possibly american italian) exploitation horrors made in late 60s-70s. It all took place in some kind of town/countryside and it was about  two guys who were sent to kill the infected/brainwashed citizens. It started with a scene where guy no.1 talked to guy no.2 over the phone. Guy no.2 was standing inside a phone booth and then one of the citizens attacked him. Citizens wore blue jumpsuits and acted violently for whatever reason. I don’t know if it had to do something with some “alien mind-control” or an infection but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a zombie movie. It was extra gory too. There was a scene where one of the guys sticked a machine gun through citizen’s chest and then started to shoot the other infected/brainwashed people. I’d be really surprised if anyone can find this…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Taste	Bad Taste
889	okay so a scene from a movie has been stuck in my head all day. It is a family in a car or (at least mom and child anyways) right before they get into a car accident the kid teleports out of the car and the only one who lives. I do not remember if it is a boy or a girl, I know at some point they try to go back and change what happened. If any person can help me with this movie I would greatly appreciate it. ? thanks in advance	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmed	Charmed
319	So I know this is going to be a difficult one. Thank you in advance for reading this.   I saw this on some movie channel on DirecTV (or whatever we had then) when I was a preteen. It was shot sometime in the late 60s or 70s. All I can remember is some woman who wakes up completely naked and starts slowing walking, trying to leave the building. She doesn’t care that she’s naked and, as she’s slowly leaving, security guards are trying to shoot and kill her but she’s either a) killing them or b) the pills can’t hit her. I can’t remember which it is. Also, if it helps, I remember her descending some large stairs in a large, open room.   I know it’s a long shot but I would seriously love some help. It’s been killing me (no pun intended) for years!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeforce_(film)	Lifeforce (film)
171	So im pretty sure that I saw this movie on Elvira one afternoon.basics are as follows: girl with long dark hair, creepy village, scary looking villagers, only safe place was in a church. She was trying to escape and thought she succeeded but then got driven directly back to the village.seems like she was wearing a long white dress too and while trying to escape she (and another person?) Use a staff with a cross on it to hold the villagers at bay by sticking it in the ground and running away. As they are about to make it out someone throws something and breaks her back. The whole village and all the scenes there look blue,like its twilite or before dawn and the only light is blue looking…help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_Club	The Monster Club
966	I remember watching this movie when I was just a little kid.  It was in the early 80s when I remember watching it.  I thought it was a old star wars movie but when asking a friend who is a star wars nut, he couldnt remember the scene.  But the scene that I remember, there was a man walking through a forest on his way to save, I think, his father and mother, and this huge harry dog like creature gets after him and he hides in a trunk of a tree to escape and the harry monster tries to get to him inside the tree.  And then something distracts the monster and he is able to leave the tree and continue on to save his parents or whoever he was trying to save.  I know all this sounds weird but I do remember the movie and I have been trying to find this movie all over the place.  If someone could please help me that would be awsome! Thanks.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_of_Courage:_An_Ewok_Adventure	Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure
173	I watched it back in the 90s on Starz or HBO or something similar. It was in Japanese with English subtitles. I remember a young girl being sick maybe… Either her father or someone that might have worked in a lab with her mother started doing tests. They put her body and or soul in this huge creepy looking monster. I only really remember the ending. A group of people were trying to put her down in a baseball field. I think her mother was trying to stop them. Idk. I can’t find this movie anywhere.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXIII:_Patlabor_the_Movie_3	WXIII: Patlabor the Movie 3
391	It was an old black and white movie I saw many years ago, there was a lady who worked in an office I believe she got fired for going out with a fellow worker, which was a company policy. I think the guy was a poor Spanish, they had gone to his cousins farm or vineyard. Their boss saw them together on the way there. Now I believe this is the same movie, she has a friend who is a secretary to a guy writing a book? I believe he was kind of rich. Both Of the girls want to get married, but the writer doesn’t see that his secretary is in love with him. One of the girls gets frustrated and is ready to leave town, but the other one comes up with a plot to keep her, and get her married. At the end of the movie the secretary is going to marry the writer guy and the other girl gets a guy too.   That’s all I can remember , thanks	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Coins_in_the_Fountain_(film)	Three Coins in the Fountain (film)
747	I saw this movie a few years ago around Halloween. I believe it might have been made in the 50’s or 60’s. A group of people are in a house.  They were talking about how vengeful and cruel (I forget if it’s uncle or father) was.  Also they were talking about their fears and how each one was suppose to die.  I believe the killer also wore a costume hinting it was the Uncle or Father. I remember one scene(slight spoiler) where their was a decapitated head on a silver tray.  I don’t want to say too much more. Any help would be great	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_the_Living_Corpse	The Curse of the Living Corpse
760	This comedy movie was first seen by me on TV in the 70s though the color quality makes me think it was created in the 60’s. The movie portrays a female ghost who loves a living guy. They both interact and may have been a couple before she died. Other ghosts make appearances in the movie too while a living suitor makes a play for the guy. Mischief thus occurs. At the end of the movie, the guy dies in a car crash, becomes a ghost too, and the couple is reunited in the afterworld. Any ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blithe_Spirit_(1945_film)	Blithe Spirit (1945 film)
818	What’s the name of this dog movie that’s very similar to homeward bound? The movie’s about a widow who lives alone with her dog. The woman’s son wants her to live with him and his family but she refuses to do so. One day the dog somehow escapes and gets lost,he later gets picked up by a truck driver. The truck driver looks at the dog’s tag but throws away his collar deciding to keep the dog to himself. He then goes in a diner and leaves the dog outside, which is when he runs away and tries to make his way back home. On his journey he lives with another family with two kids for a little while and helps them set free some stray dogs that had been captured and were living in cages. Later he and another dog find a girl who lives with her grandfather and can’t walk, so they stay with her until Christmas season is over, the girl gives a cross necklace to the female dog before they leave her. The female dog gets ran over by a car and a traveler buries her and accompanies the pooch for a little while before parting ways. In the end the dog manages to get back to his original owner just as she’s about to move away with her son.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hambone_and_Hillie	Hambone and Hillie
1025	So the first thing I remember is they were having a get together/ party outdoors and someone mistakenly puts wet cat food on the table and someone eats it with a cracker. Next thing I remember is a shooting scene, most people at the home are killed and I remember a younger person hiding and seeing all the blood shed but is unharmed. Then they are forced to travel through a desert? I believe it was a young girl and a boy traveling, at one point they dig in the sand and are able to find water and then at some point the come upon a cave. The end of the movie is them finally being rescued or finally crossing the desert.

1007	Hello there! I saw this movie quite a while ago (10 years?) and here are the details I remember: – black and white, though I’m not sure if it was really old or made to look old – Frankenstein style scientist, who had “creations” running errands for him – those creations could be regenerated if he even had the smallest bodypart, for example a finger, that would be placed into a machine (I distinctly remember a metal spiral) and run through with electricity – I think I remember that the creations were kidnapping young women for the scientist to cast them in wax (I’m not sure, I could be mixing this up) – I also think those creations murdered at least a few people – underneath all the grimness, I remember the movie having a humorous undertone, which is why I think it could have been satirical – the whole movie had a little bit of a Frankenstein / the Munsters / the Addams family vibe to it. I’d be really grateful if someone remembers this ? Thx, Caramelia	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_On_Screaming!	Carry On Screaming!
343	I was probably three when my parents took me to a drive-in where they watched this bizarre film about several young women staying at some remote home. I remember a few scenes that stuck with me: One scene I remember one of the young women snuck into a room with a refrigerator and found the severed heads of her friends on the refrigerator shelves. Another scene I remember, the older woman that lived in the house was cooking something in a large soup pot and either her husband or son asked her what was cooking, opened up the lid of the pot and a human foot was floating in the soup. They both smiled like it was the most normal thing in the world. One of the end scenes was the last young woman winds up falling in love with the son of the cannibal family, and it’s the last survivor young woman in the kitchen making soup out of the parents, I think their heads were now in the fridge. If anyone can help me place this film it would be much appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_at_Red_Wolf_Inn	Terror at Red Wolf Inn
155	See ~35 years ago All I remember is a giant metal robot guarding a hill.  Somehow the group was able to get past the robot and into a cave behind or underneath the machine.  The group spoke to the machines keeper and then noticed an entrance to another chamber behind a pile of junk. (The chambers door was blocked by junk).  Past the door was a large cave where the group found a white flower growing on a small hill in the center of the cave. That’s all I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Adventure	Arabian Adventure
695	This should be horror but it would only let me chose mystery…. I watched this about 13 or 14 years ago on TV.  I suspect when shadow lane had just come out  (If you live in BC I’m sure you’ll remember  the movie stations that were free when they came out).   A family ( mom dad and two kids I believe) takes a wrong turn and ends up in this old abandoned mining town ( it’s not exactly a wrong turn as I believe the gas station attendant was in on it.  Someone changes a sign and that’s how they take the wrong turn). the father I believe was happy to explore the town only it’s not so abandoned.   Turned out people who lived in said town didn’t want to leave fled to the tunes (mine shafts) when nuke testing started (it’s years later now though or they would have you believe.)  Anyways one of the kids falls into this shaft and finds a pile of clothing (we now know this wasn’t just an accident).     I remember a field of old cars shown from above at one point (all prev victim vehicles I assumed at the time).  I also remember a giant white almost glass like crater that I always assumed was made by the nuke that was supposedly tested.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_(2002_film)	Disappearance (2002 film)
387	I saw this movie in the early 80’s but I think it was older, mabey 60’s or 70’s.  The movie involves a group of people riding a train that stops in the middle of nowhere. The group gets off the train and come upon some type of ruins. After dark several crypts open up and skeletons armed with knives and swords emerge and start killing the members of the group. I remember the end where the lone survivor, a woman, is riding a horse to get away.

The scary woman’s hands are outstretched as she is walking.  Every time the woman gets to a different hallway you see the outstretched hands of the scary woman coming around the corner.  I think it was in black and white but I’m not positive.  I’m dying to know the name of it. I watched it when I was babysitting so it was on regular TV.  There was no cable at the time.

758	There’s a young woman standing in a shop, looks like an antique or curio store, and she is staring out the window. I believe she had dark hair, but it’s black and white, so it might have been hard to tell. I think there was another woman with her to the right on screen, who ran the shop. The camera cuts to the window, where outside some little girls are jumping rope and chanting a nursery rhyme. They might be blond. I think there are two of them. It cuts back to the woman looking out the window, who says “Those kids-” and looks horrified or scared. The kids had a creepy vibe, like children in a horror movie. I guess there was some significance to them. That’s all I remember, so the woman may have finished her sentence and I forgot it. For a while I was convinced that it was from the old Twilight Zone episodes from the sixties, but I watched all the ones I have and haven’t seen anything like that. I also keep searching on the Internet about this show and girls jumping rope, but nothing helpful comes up. I saw it a long time ago when I was a kid, maybe ten years ago, so my memory is fuzzy. There’s the gist of it; I may have gotten some details wrong. Thanks so much if you can help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait-Jacket	Strait-Jacket

770	I saw this movie probably 25 years ago or so, and it was old then. Although I seem to remember it being a Twilight Zone movie, I have started second guessing myself as I can’t find any record of it… I remember it as a full length movie with the Twilight Zone theme, but older than most Twilight Zone episodes. It was a black and white movie, and the main character (man) was a guest at a manor house or castle I think. He went out to a beach (lake or sea?), where suddenly a woman emerges from the the deep water and walks up on the beach. I don’t remember much else apart from there being a portrait of the woman inside the manor house, and that at the end it turns out the woman has been dead for a long time, and she ages very quickly in front of the man, her skin and muscles start melting away and she turns into a skeleton (and dust?).

752	when I was a kid I remember seeing an old western film. It was probably from the 60’s or 70’s. It was a series of flashbacks from somebody in jail waiting to be hanged. The story told from the flashbacks made you see the prisoner and their actions that lead to their arrest in a sympathetic light.  Not only that but two guys sang every once and a while to narrate this tale. I think they had a banjo/guitar.

856	So, I’ve watched this movie I think 10 years ago, min!  I remember that it starts like this: it’s raining, it’s night. Movie is divided in four parts. Every part is named: Beginning of the beginning, end of the beginning, beginning of an end, end of an end. Only few people in this movie have really intense color of azure blue eyes and it means something important. Somewhere in the movie, one of the lead roles die. He has short black hair, wears glasses, and is scientist or something like that. The comet comes striking from the universe and it hits only him! There is a young boy who is searching for his mother, I think, and he finds her in some secret room, filled with light, and I think she dies when she meets him.    I really hope someone will know what movie is this! I’ve been searching for it for few years now, whenever I remember, but without a result. Make me happy people pleaaaase! ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discovery_of_Heaven	The Discovery of Heaven
886	Ok so I don’t really remember anything but one scene, so I will try to give as much detail as I can. I saw this movie when I was very young and only remember this scene because (from what I remember) I don’t think I actually watched most of the movie because I found it pretty scary, so it is probably not a children/family movie. I think I watched it in 2006 (mid-end of the year probably) and it was on a tv in someone’s house, so it was old enough to be released on tv/dvd (not still in cinemas). It was in English and colour I’m pretty sure. So this scene: There was a (or multiple) giant robot-like things and I think they were sort of sphere shaped. It was destroying a city and going around picking people up (possible killing them?) in giant net-like things i think. There was a father and daughter (i think it was a daughter) and they ended up getting separated because the father got picked up by the robot thing. When the robot thing was picking people up there was a lot of red liquid stuff (quite possibly blood, but maybe something else?). In the end I think the father made it back to the daughter. And that is all I remember, sorry if it is vague, but really hope someone can help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Worlds_(2005_film)	War of the Worlds (2005 film)
308	So I saw this in the late 90s possibly early 20s on TV,  it was a colour film in english. I only remember one scene but it stuck with me. It has these people dressed up like its halloween and they are partying in what seemed to be underground, and then something attacks them.  It’s all shots designed to hide what’s killing them, but eventually the first person (a black guy dressed as a basketball player ) gets to this door and yells at a larger guy (fat guy) to open the door, but the guy doesn’t. The basketball guy is reaching through a slit in the door trying to open it and then there’s a bunch of noises. The large guy grabs the arm and it comes out. So he’s there holding a severed arm. It then cuts to what I think is the main character (a dude) showering. As I was watching with my younger sis that’s when I had to change the channel. Have always wanted to see the end. I know it’s vague but any help would be appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_Paris	An American Werewolf in Paris
715	Hi all, i don’t remember much at all but I’m sure it was shown on true movies. I think it’s in  1980’s . I think one of the first scenes is her at work smoking with a colleague . I think she’s got short blonde hair Its about a mother who gives birth to a baby and the baby is either premature or just unwell. I think she might’ve been a drug addict or alcoholic. I remember that it’s the mothers fault why her baby is unwell I remember one scene when she’s on the beach with her baby and dog comes up to her barking at her and the baby then the baby is back in hospital again??

This is like in college or something. But when he grabs the door and tries to open it, it is locked. He then shakes his head and sits down in front of it. Then somebody else walks up, and opens the other door, he looks around to make sure nobody saw his mistake, and runs inside. I am not sure if this is in the opening credits of some TV show, or it’s a scene from a movie, or what. But this has been frustrating me for about 6 days now. My wife thinks I’m crazy. Please help. This is live action, full color, probably late eighties to Mid nineties and on American TV comma whether it was a movie on TV or TV show I am not sure.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Boy	Tommy Boy
1071	The opening scene of the film has a girl with a scarred faced and it’s in black and white at a diner. Everyone in the diner is disgusted by her appearance (not only her physical appearance, but her presence in the room). I’ve been on this website before looking for the name of the film, and I found it once, I just can’t remember the name of it again. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_(film)	The Final (film)
464	So I think this was an opening scene, but a flower (I think a dandelion) is crushed by a foot, and a man then comes follows and fixes the flower before walking into a gloomy business building. I want to say this is an ’80’s-’90s movie. I originally thought it was Gremlins, so thinking it is something out of that dark light-hearted vein.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Versus_the_Volcano	Joe Versus the Volcano
408	This has been bugging the heck out me. It’s a horror movie I believe. It starts out in black and white (more of a grayish tone) at a small restaurant. A girl walks in with a red hoodie on (the hoodie may be the only thing in color, maybe not). Everyone in the restaurant seems to recognize her when she walks in. Her face is badly disfigured. People seem to be uncomfortable with her being in the room while they’re trying to eat their meals. The people in the restaurant also seem to stare at her and whisper about her till a she gets to a point she can’t stand anymore. She stands up and yells something out like “Is this what you want” and takes off her hoodie to show her disfigured face, then the opening credits start to roll. This is how I think the opening starts. I’ve looked through my movie selections for months to try and find it, with no luck. I had a head injury a few years ago so sometimes I don’t put information back together correctly. I hope I can an answer here. Thanks in advance for any help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_(film)	The Final (film)
278	Hi everyone! I remember watching this movie at a theater somewhat around 1976-79. Most likely it was in black and white and of a Western genre. The plot is not that different from the well known “Curly Sue”, “Alice in the Cities” or even “True Grit” and revolves around a journey of a middle-aged man and a little girl through the Wild West. I remember this man as a corpulent black-bearded cowboy taking care of a girl who was either his daughter or some orphaned child. All I recall is just this one scene: The man and the girl are making pancakes (or tortillas), and the man is showing the girl some sort of a trick – he throws the pancake up into the air, then catches it, then throws and catches it again. At some point, he throws the pancake and it disappears. Then both man and girl lift their eyes and see that the pancake is stuck to the ceiling. Several years ago, I’ve been told that this film is, perhaps, “The Paper Moon” by “Peter Bogdanovich… However, I rewatched it a few years back and never saw such a scene. Any help on identificating this movie is highly appreciated!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_Out	Shoot Out
774	I saw a movie on tv about 10 years ago (maybe more).. about people being held captive in small metal boxes, or cages. The boxes were stacked somewhat like a Rubik’s Cube. The boxes would twist and turn at certain intervals. Sometimes the box would open to an adjoining box/cage and the prisoner could choose to enter that adjoining box. Anyway, the movie is centered on a young woman prisoner (dark hair.) I was thinking it was Jennifer Lopez and I saw that she was in a movie called The Cell, but that movie is described differently so it can’t be that. I think I remember the prisoners can see through the front of the cage, so they have a view of others who are being held.  The woman sees other prisoners making choices.. some are killed because their choices are wrong. The only way out is to solve the life size Rubik’s Cube’s twists and turns and the woman is able to do it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(film_series)	Cube (film series)
415	I saw this about ten years ago. Two scenes stuck out to me. The first was about people trying to leave a cave and they had to lay flat on the ground and stay quiet as a large, rock-like object that was slowly spinning passed on by above them. It had a lot of holes which had light shining out of them. There was a scene that had a kid open a door from his bedroom, I think, and the shot is of him screaming into the face of whatever is on the other side. The camera is in front of him and facing him. He is covered in a blinding and flashing light. The whole thing was in color and English.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invaders_from_Mars_(1986_film)	Invaders from Mars (1986 film)

Seeing that girl they started to follow her. Then they wore mask. When the girl realized that she was being followed she started to run and escape. But before she could do that they caught her. Then one of the men beats her and then rapes her. And other man was holding a gun. Before raping the girl the man removes his mask. When the girl was screaming there was a train going over a bridge above them. When they were leaving the girl the other man who was holding the gun said,” Hey man, she saw your face.” The man who raped the girl said,” I know, let her go.” Can anyone guess which movie is this.

538	OK Guys. Here goes nothing. I remember this movie that I saw the tail end of on TV many years ago, perhaps 2006 or so. I remembered post apocalyptic kinds of themes and low production values. It had zombies or some equivalent. And people were trying to get off world (I Think). So I seem to remember some sci-fi thrown in. OK so the one thing I remember for sure: the was a man, I think the main character, and he is impaled on the outside of this spinning weel at the end of the movie. He’s ventured deep underground to fight the zombies or something. That’s all I got! Anyone know this movie?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_Chronicles_(film)	Mutant Chronicles (film)
261	I was a young kid so this had to be late 80’s or early 90’s when I saw this clip. I think the show was from 70s. Either black and white or that light techni-color(?) that isnt really bright color.  I saw it on t.v., even though I strongly remember it being a movie, and only really remember one scene vividly. I believe there are two kids and they are staying ag this old house in the woods; its a two story house. Not sure if they are on vacation or have parents there. But at one point, one kid gets trapped under water either under tree branches or under ice (but I’m pretty sure its summer so ice would be odd). I think the old woman (witch) is in the window makig this happen.  She is bad, maybe only the kids know it. I think the kid gets out just barely before it (she?) would have died. It was in english. And im guessing suitable for a kid to watch. Please help, I have been seeing this clip and trying to figure this movie out for years!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watcher_in_the_Woods_(1980_film)	The Watcher in the Woods (1980 film)
628	I’m not sure if this was a killer computer movie or not. I remember watching it in the early-mid 2000’s. Not really sure on how it started or what really goes on in the movie as i was about 7 or 8 when i watched it the first time. I know there was a group of teens and they ended up in this building some how. I think they broke in. I’m not sure if it was a lab of some sort or a school but it had many rooms. The main part i remember is a boy in the room with the computer and the computer trying to prevent the boy from doing something. I think the boy was trying to shut down the computer. One part in the movie there’s 2 kids outside together trying to run around the building or run away from the building to do something. I know I’m not giving a whole lot of information about this movie and i apologize but if you could help me out that would be fantastic because I have been searching for this one movie for a couple years now and it is very frustrating.

I watched it when I was pretty young and it scared the hell out of me, but I don’t think it’s actually all that scary? The only thing I can remember is a scene (maybe a few different ones?) in which a man, I think dressed as a bellhop, with large, round glasses hits somebody with some sort of cart. I can vaguely picture somebody laying in bed and looking over by the door, when this bellhop guy runs at them with a rolling cart type thing and hits them.

Maybe a brown haired girl with a blue dress and another with an orange dress. Saw it in the year 2000. It was in English. It was an animation in color on a VHS tape. Not 3D animation but flat.

599	I don’t recall much of anything about this movie besides the ending. I watched it on VHS tape in the early 90s at a friend’s house. It is an American movie and in color. I used to think it was a David Lynch film, as we were watching a lot of his other stuff at the time, but after reviewing many of his other titles, it doesn’t seem that it is – although the movie has a similar feel of being filled with disturbing scenes and people. The setting is in an American suburb, I think in the Southwest. The home where much of the movie takes place has a pool in the back yard. The main character is some sort of mentally disturbed weirdo loser. Mainly what I remember at the end is someone (the main character?) packing a suitcase and smiling happily while their mom is angrily calling them from the next room. But at the same time you see a fresh bloodstain slowly growing on the ceiling overhead, suggesting the mom may have been murdered. It isn’t clear which is the hallucination, the voice calling or the growing bloodstain because the movie ends there.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_29	Track 29

He lures them into the cave, and the next thing they know they are locked in a cell with other people also being held captive and the farmer divulges he is holding them to be food for his “creature”, which looks just like the creature from the black lagoon, except it isn’t the creature from the black lagoon.

256	I remember seeing it as a kid (mid 90s, colour).  I don’t remember much, but I do remember a few details. 1. There was a worm or bug that would burrow into people through the foot, and work its way through their body until it finally killed them. 2. When people were about to die, they would hear the sea singing to them (I seem to recall that everyone present could hear it, not just the person dying. Also not sure if that was death in general, or just death by foot-worm). 3. There were doctors who would operate on people with “magic” gloves that would allow them to reach into people’s bodies without making incisions – there was some sort of training involved, and one of the main characters failed to save someone’s life because he couldn’t get the gloves to penetrate the patient’s skin. 4. It was set in a Victorian-esque setting, with horse drawn carriages 5. There was a firm divide between an area of permanent darkness and an area of light (can’t remember if the light area ever experienced night, but the dark one would never get day) 6. There was a scene where a king (or some such prominent royalty/courtier) was assassinated by having one of the aforementioned worms inserted into his food while he was sleeping (incidentally, this is the reason I cannot to this day sleep without my feet covered. As a kid this movie freaked me out, so no matter how hot it is, my feet must be covered.) 7. I remember a conversation in a carriage about weather balloons.  I think that was near the beginning, and I have this idea that the main character is from a “normal” reality and this magical place is just as weird to him as it is to the audience.

753	Okay, please bear with me as this might be a bit weird. But I do need confirmation that this movie exists and I didn’t go crazy in my teens.   Back in the early ’00s I woke up early before school around six in the morning. This movie was on either HBO or Cinemax only around the pre-dawn time slot, for good reason. Now, here comes the crazy. What I remember is: This movie was a raunchy comedy-esque/oddity/porn(?) it feels The movie was about a crew filming as movie Two lead actors were filming a sex scene, but ended up having sex on the spot in front of the crew. There was a transgender(?) male who had a bunch of jars with parts of his mutilated but living father in it, including his father’s penis. A woman counter-raped said male and ran in disgust. And a woman with large breasts had them shot off with a shotgun.   Weird, huh? I haven’t been able to find any proof that this film exists online because I’ve forgotten the name, and I can’t find anyone who knows what I’m talking about. Now I know this movie exists as it was on either of those channels for a good run of almost a year. But if it was one of those after hour/Skinemax films then…. I’m scared.   But please, if you have an inkling of what I’m talking about please help me prove that this movie is real. Thank you.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_Firmer	Terror Firmer
589	I have only seen the trailer for this movie, so I can’t really summarize the whole plot. The movie is in German, I think, but it could also be Dutch or Flemish. A strange/looking man moves into the home of a family and he proceeds to dominate the family’s life. The man looks like a homeless person, with a long beard, he is very dirty and wearing hardly any clothes if I remember correctly. He doesn’t speak. In one scene I think he is taking a bath in the family’s tub. From what I remember of the trailer the man is not really a man but some sort of mythical creature, but having not seen the film itself, I cannot be sure.  I think the title is a single (odd) word, but I could be wrong. I think it came out within the last five years, but it could be a few years older than that.

678	Hi Recently I saw a movie about a couple, in this movie people were able to Block each other in real life so they wouldn’t see their faces or hear their voices. In this movie wife blocks her husband and the man is not able to see his wife(instead of her body he just sees colors) he finds out his wife is pregnant… He can’t see his wife because his child is blocked too After his wife’s death he goes to see his child, but it’s not his child… the child dies and now this dude is globally blocked by everyone.(people see him as a green color which shows how dangerous he is) I think it’s a recent 2015-2016 American movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(Black_Mirror)	White Christmas (Black Mirror)

519	Ok, so my hubby, brother-in-law, and I rented a movie from redbox in the mid 2000’s (around the time streaming was becoming big) and I gotta say, we were glad we only paid a buck for it. This movie was so bad we talked and joked through the entire thing like the robots out of MST3K. But it bothers me that none of us can remember the name of the movie or what it was about. The only thing any of us really remember was it took place is completely or mostly in a third world country and near the end this woman, American I think, was standing either topless or naked in a bunch of mud and was surrounded by young boys. Most of whom were somewhere around 12-14 years old. And they start covering her in mud and as they do so, they are groping her breasts and ass. Not sure if they were supposed to, but they were. I think this scene stuck with us because it was about the best part of the movie and the only thing even relatively exciting that happened. We kept watching hoping that it would get better at some point. That someone didn’t actually, from start to finish, make a movie that terrible. I hope someone can help, because I would really like that know what that movie was supposed to be about and what it was called.

398	I remember once watching a movie on IFC when I was younger, around 2007-2008. It is a film about a lizard man/ reptile monster who just wants to be accepted/ or is possibly a drunk (either or, I can’t quite remember). One of the only memorable scenes in the movie is this one; the man is suddenly homeless after being brought back to civilization and proceeds to get urinated on by passerbys. Any ideas?? This keeps me up at night ;-;	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Such_Thing_(film)	No Such Thing (film)
864	This has been driving me bonkers for years. There’s a movie where a robot woman has sex with men and kills them during with weird tools that come out of her body (some kind of spinning maces out of her chest, weird straws that suck out people’s insides, buzzsaws for ladyparts etc.) I think it was around the late 80’s early 90’s that I saw it on TV. Lots of people on the internet. Here’s another description that I’m POSITIVE is the same movie, but they did not get an answer either, haha. Sometime in the late 70s or early 80s I remember seeing a movie on local TV that I did not understand (I was a somewhat-sheltered little kid in those days). All I remember is that there were women in the movie who were robots or androids of some sort (perfect human replicas a la Blade Runner), who killed at least a couple of men via sex. I remember one scene pretty clearly in which one of these women had her breasts sort of start spinning like small buzzsaws out of her clothes, killing whatever guy was with her. Another scene I really vividly remember had one of these fembots straddling a man (on the floor, I think, with both of them mostly clothed). The man was enjoying himself at first, “Oooooohhhh, ahhhhh,” and then he started to scream and shriek. At the time I had no idea what was going on, but later on when I learned about the birds and the bees I realized that the bot-woman must have killed him with her vagina (something buzz-saw-y like the other chick’s breasts). Does anyone else remember a movie like this? We never had cable (we were too poor), and it was definitely not something I would have been allowed to watch had my father been home/awake. My hazy memory tells me it was something I must have watched either in the afternoon after school, or on a weekend while my father slept in or was otherwise occupied. (And if you have trouble believing that scenario, consider that I saw Satan’s Cheerleaders and Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark on TV under those exact circumstances when I was a kid. I don’t think this was part of the “Bionic Woman” fembot thing, but if there are screenshots proving me wrong on that, I’ll take ’em.

888	I saw this movie on TV years ago. It looked like it was made in the late 90s maybe early 2000s. It’s about a guy and 2 girls. The guy is like a cartoonist. Very important detail for the ending. So the guy is interested in 1 girl and his friend (2nd girl) helps them get together. In the process they fall in love. But it don’t last because like I said he gets the girl of his “dreams” only to realize towards the end he loves his friend. So now the first girl helps him get his friend back. The ending of the movie has him drawing up a cartoon of him and her being together which he shows on a film projector outside her window. Making her laugh she runs down from her apartment to him and… Well you know. Happy ending.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Women_(film)	100 Women (film)
105	I am trying to remember the title of a film about a woman who meets a handsome guy in the city when she was in a line and wanted to buy some food or drink and she didnt have enough cash on her but a credit card or something, then a guy behind her pays for her because he says although the item costs less if he waited and paid just for him self it wasnt worth it because its worth the money to get the item sooner by paying for her’s too. I want to teach my Chinese friends in China about why white people are not as cheap as they are (because they are more trifty). The scene from teh movie would help illustrate the pont.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_a_Shopaholic_(film)	Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)
916	Saw this on TV years ago so I think it was B&W or that could just have been our telly. British film from 50’s / 60’s about two boys running away from a city (possibly London) by stowing away on a removals van. An important scene is when the van stops at one point and removal men check the load. They are concerned that a potted plant might suffer on the journey. One of the men checks it and says if feels well watered (implying the boys have been using it as a toilet!). Thought I’d found it myself but was wrong so I can say it’s not ‘On the Run’ (1968)	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Ones	The Little Ones
239	I saw the movie in the early 90s, English language, and in color. I watched it on TV, but I believe it was a feature film. The ending involved a young boy, probably 8-10 years old, walking around a burnt out house. I think there were firefighters walking around in full gear, ignoring the boy. The house was burned enough that it was exposed to the outside. I don’t know if his family was dead or simply gone, but he was apparently left alone after returning from some adventure. I believe the whole movie had a somber, sad tone and may have been a  fantasy in line with the Jim Henson movies of that time period (Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, etc). Unfortunately I cannot remember anything else about the plot or characters. Any help is much appreciated. This has been bothering me for at least 15 years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Bandits	Time Bandits
893	The trailer is about a father/ son of Chinese descent I think. His father is a merchant and tricks the son him by selling him to another family ( I think). The son then grows up learning from another master and ends up being a warrior of some type. It’s something along those lines. Any ideas..it’s driving me crazy.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(TV_series)	Marco Polo (TV series)
450	Ok, so all I know is this one part of this supernatural movie. Husband and wife, in I think the living room of a house. I don’t remember what else is going on, but the husband has some sort of creature be vomited from his mouth. After the creature is out, it appears on another side of the room, this huge, red mass. The wife yells something along the lines of either look what you did, or look what you did to my husband. Wish I had more.

503	Can’t remember the country of origin but I believe it was Scandinavian. About a male creature that lives in the woods and travels to people’s homes to cause trouble. The movie opens with him in an underground bunker in the woods being chased out by hunters. He’s a short qirey guy with scraggly hair. He ends up at a family’s home where the wife eventually asks him to kill her husband. He takes shelter in a little shed in their backyard unbeknownst to the husband. There are strange scenes of him sitting on the husband or wife’s chest while they sleep which made me think the creature was an Alp but my searches haven’t found anything like that. Movie came out some time in the past 10 years. Help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgman_(film)	Borgman (film)
723	*not a native english speaker so bear with me* When I was a kid I lived in a small village and we had 2-3 channels on the TV. We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can’t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook… maybe… The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn’t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can’t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here’s some conversation they had: Daughter: “We’ve been passing by that cabin all night” Father: “This is a military road, all the cabins look the same” *some arguing and desperation* Father: “If we keep driving we should be OK” *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending… The father somehow disappeared, can’t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can’t remember. So if it was her family maybe coma, if it wasn’t maybe she was found. Spent years trying to find the movie, if it turn out to have been a dream I’m going to feel really stupid.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End_(2003_film)	Dead End (2003 film)
905	I cant stop thinking about this movie. I watched it on netflix in about 2010 or 2011 but i cant remember the title. It was from the 80s or 90s or possibly the 70s and all i can remember is there was a man who wore white face powder and he kidnapped a girl and kept her in this cage like thing in his room or another room in his house. Her dad or boyfriend found her and the guy who kidnapped her went to prison but he got out sometime at the end of the movie.

550	This scene has stuck with me for years and I have never been able to figure out where it’s from. I think it’s from a movie, but it’s possible it was a t.v. show. I’m pretty sure it’s from the 80s. This is what I remember: There is a door (I remember it being white and maybe with red markings on it but that could be wrong) on the side of a highway or road. No one is supposed to go through the door. Two teens are missing and it looks like they went through the door, I think I remember cops being outside the door and maybe an upset parent. No one on the search team goes too far into the cave system behind the door. Later, other teens want to try and find them and I think there was something about using a rope tied to the entrance to ensure they would find their way back. I think the premise was that whoever went through the door would be lost forever. Any ideas? Was it a movie?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazes_and_Monsters	Mazes and Monsters
1008	I saw it on TV during the 70’s or 80’s. It was in English, and in color. I don’t remember the actors or much about the plot. It was a scary movie set in Louisiana. There was a killer, and an old house with a barn behind it. The killer murdered somebody (perhaps a cop) in the barn using a pitchfork. This has been bugging me for years.

910	So I’m having a hard time remembering this movie or if it even actually existed since I’m the only one who seems to vaguely remember it. It aired on TV sometime between 2008-2011 because I remember it well enough to have scared the living crap out of young me. I think it was on nickelodeon, Disney channel, or cartoon network because those were the only channels we had at the time, but I can’t find anything. I remember a town being haunted by something and people were going missing, so these kids figured out what was happening and it turned out there were these alien-like creatures who were stealing people and wrapping them in a cocoon made out of goo. I think it like, slowly ate away at the person but I can’t remember. I can vaguely remember a scene where they’re crawling through some type of piping system underground to find the creatures nest and they had to be super quiet, but the creaturest eventually noticed and took one of the kids, a boy a believe. The creatures were gooey with sharp teeth if I remember right too. Sorry for the really long post, but this is going to bug me forever if I can’t find this movie!!!!!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_Hour:_The_Series	The Haunting Hour: The Series
474	I remember this really weird science fiction movie from the either 80’s or 90’s that I have not seen in over a decade. There was a scene where there was a character talking to this alien that looked like a fusion of a human male and female. When it spoke, it sounded like a man and a woman talking at the same time. It was in color and in English.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(1978_TV_series)	Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)

121	I was very young approximately 1969, watching on television. I believe it was black and white but I am not sure as I also remember we had a black and white TV. It was in English. I believe I saw parts of it twice and there was something about the Ambiance that I enjoyed. The only scene I remember was Spacemen on another planet , one guy picked up something from the ground I believe, the size of his fist, look like a rock or a fossil , and he is able to open it up or split it in two, which reveals a man made object inside. It looked like a jewelry cameo of a sort . I think it was the image of a woman’s face like a cameo would have, but my memory is very fuzzy on this. My recollection is that this was giving evidence of a life-form that was otherwise not proven to exist? This may have even been the end of the movie but I am not sure about that either.

506	I saw a movie as a kid on tv , it was made in the 1960s or early 1970s. It was about an older ,45-60 yrs old, scientist thats makes a monster. The monster leaves/escapes and tears off the scientist’s  index finger.The scientists looked like Peter Cushing. I can’t remember if it was black and white or color but color seems to ring a bell more. I was only 5 yrs old and my parents made me go to bed before it was over and I still think about the ending.The thing that struck me the most is the torn off finger.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creeping_Flesh	The Creeping Flesh

730	I’m trying for many years to find the title of this movie, which I watched on tv during my childhood (1980’s). I first assumed it was Dune, but was never able to find such scene in it. It’s a sci-fi / fantasy type of movie, set in a desert-like place. A lot of dunes, wind, etc. It remember it having an old feel for the time, so maybe from the end of the 1970’s? The scene I remember involves a worm type monster (hence the Dune thoughts) that lived in a hole surrounded by the dunes. The main characters/heroes had to be careful not be dragged by this worm (tentacles?) back to its hole/den. This happens with one of the main characters, and I never forgot him being dragged screaming by the foot to the hole in the sand. The worm, or tentacle, was not large but long, more like a snake. I also seem to remember it being in the future, or maybe the characters had suits/astronaut gear. Thanks! ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_Mine_%28film%29	Enemy Mine %28film%29
690	Hi, I saw this movie on HBO sometime around 2000’s. What I can say is that is was a sci-fi dystopian movie, with the action taking place in the future with city states, wars and so on. I’m not sure if it was animated or CGI. There was a team consisting of soldiers and ‘witches’ that were women with some devices that granted them telekinetic abilities, like the ability to control some black energy hands that appeared from the ground and crushed their enemies. Also at a certain point they had to cross through a tunnel in a passage underground, and they had to do it during nighttime, because during the day it would get incandescent. And I think one of the team didn’t make it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_Cause_(film)	For the Cause (film)
544	Scifi, girl abducted, man and women go into space on a mission Saw on TV, in late 1990s or early 2000s. Video was probably made during the same time. Decent (modern) production value, especially for a space adventure. Long video, so probably a made-for-TV movie or a TV pilot. Begins on a distant planet or moon (i.e. not Earth). World full of humans and a few aliens. Surface looks like a desert. A lot of brown tents surrounding a marketplace. Some broad dusty steps leading to a larger building. Man with some dark desert garb goes into town, finds a bar. Unknown occupation. Man receives a mission or finds a job, here. Later, there might have been a bar fight. Black-haired woman joins his crew, the next day. They go off-planet on a ship to complete a job or mission. Later, on the same planet, a girl is kidnapped by some aliens. The aliens have creepy faces, but otherwise are humanoid. They live underground in a bright red cave, with plenty of tunnels. The red is so bright, that it seems like some kind of plant growth. Above the surface, the aliens wear robes, and look like some type of religious priesthood. They are doing something to the kid’s mind, as part of a ritual… Anyways, man and woman defeat some big bad, there’s a “gun” fight on the bridge of a bigger ship. Then they race back to the planet to save the girl. I don’t think the movie / pilot was well-received. The video did not seem like the generic: alien invasion, time travel, monster, or space exploration molds, so it is really hard to place.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warlord:_Battle_for_the_Galaxy	The Warlord: Battle for the Galaxy
676	Sci-Fi/ Horror flick seen on Saturday afternoon in 70s but the movie might be older with plesiosaur-looking monsters (loch Ness monster shape) but only as big as a man and they crawled on belly.

1037	Hi everyone, This is a sci-fi movie I watched when I was younger and have been trying to find the title for the longest time with no luck. It was in English and was filmed in color. I believe it was a sci-fi movie that had to do with these slimy creatures that kind of resembled/acted like leeches but were much larger in size, kind of like mini-octopus?? I think the creatures might have been created by the government, I can’t quite remember. There are two specific scenes I recall, one was that this creature was inside a mailbox and when someone opened it, it attacked and latched onto their face (sorry for the imagery). Another scene was when a person was taking a shower in a large stand up shower place (like in a locker room) and you see them showering and then they turn around and the camera angle cuts to the creature being on their back. I recall much of the movie with the creature being on people’s backs. Idk why. Even on child’s back and they were so nonchalant about it like it’s no big deal. If you can tell me what this movie is, I would greatly appreciate it!!  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Puppet_Masters_(film)	The Puppet Masters (film)
523	I have been wracking my brain over this title for years. There are only 4 characters that I remember, but I dont remember their names, so lets call them; good guy, bad guy, fat guy, and ladyface. So the plot as far as I remember is that good guy, and bad guy work in the same labratory together, making biohazard super suits. Good guy and ladyface are bf/gf or husband/wife. And then there is fat guy who if I remember right only serves to be the creepy stalker guy for ladyface. Ok something goes down in the lab between good guy and bad guy, and while good guy is in a test cell bad guy burns him alive to try and take credit for all of their work and to steal ladyface from good guy. Well good guy is badly burned, but not dead, and his super suit is damaged, leaking this white paste, but still operational. Well good guy goes on a murder death kill rampage and one thing leads to another and good guy is in an alley way with fat guy in a car. Well fat guy tries his luck at running good guy over and to no avail. Good guy quickly turns the tables on fat guy and pushes the car and crushes the poor fat bastard in his car like a tube of tooth paste. Then naturally the good guy and the bad guy have a final showdown in their super suits. Hopefully that is enough info for you guys to help me figure this out.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vindicator_(film)	The Vindicator (film)

184	This was a very short film on the Sci-Fi channel some time in the late 90’s. I don’t know if it was English-made or otherwise as there was little to no dialogue. It all took place in one room, likely a very small apartment, almost like a closet. I believe the colours of the room were very dim and dull. There is a possibility that it may have been done in stop-motion, although I am fairly certain it was not claymation. Two people were seated facing each other and it was a mealtime. One of them pulled the other’s tie like a dumbwaiter rope, reached into his button-down shirt, and pulled a tray of food out. At another point he also made utensils pop out of the other person’s ears.   This was not a horror film. Both characters were alive. It was just mean to be very odd and probably more meaningful than I was able to comprehend at the time I saw it. Thank for any help! ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_(film)	Food (film)

1086	I saw a small part of what looked like either a movie or a show but I cannot seem to recall which. I saw it around evening time while in a hotel in Florida in early June 2014. I can’t remember if the channel it was airing on was either an HBO channel or Syfy channel. I remember seeing a guy who was restrained in a chair with other men who I think where dressed like the mafia. They were telling the guy that is in the chair that if he tells anyone that they exists that his memories week be erased. I also remember that the guy that was in the chair was trying to find this girl who he apparently has met in previous lives in the past, like they are always ment to be together no matter what life they are in. However the people that are dressed like the mafia are trying to stop the man from meeting her and they are using there powers to manipulate the space sound him to catch him. A few examples of the powers these people have would be like when they open a closet door it takes them to a street that they want to be at but when a normal person opens the closet door it’s just a normal closet. They can also manipulate machines I think? Like they seemed to induce a car crash when the man that is trying to find the girl tried to get in a taxi to get away but the men stopped the taxi by causing it to crash, almost killing him.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adjustment_Bureau	The Adjustment Bureau
1093	Watched this movie on youtube’s free movies around 2012. It was low budget either a B movie or a very similar . Plot – A man who i think was a doctor (worked in a lab) was exposed to some foreign mass i think a meteor or similar and a growth started to develop on him. Turns out this is a parasite and he eventually gives birth to a creature with several limbs. The creature is taken away, but the man fights for the right for it to be released under some sort of human rights or parental rights – I believe the main point of the movie was to discuss the rights of a child (or lack of) if it was not technically a human (half human/half alien) – I think the title of the movie was a word that defined this but I cannot remember it at all. There is a court case where the creature is in fact released into the control of the man (father). Thanks.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InAlienable	InAlienable
863	I am trying to identify several film & TV stills in a movie book (published in the US in 1965) with unlabeled pictures from various movies, serials, and a few TV programs. I managed to identify most of the stills, but a handful have eluded me. First is a photo probably from a 1940s-50s western showing the shadows on a wall of a woman sitting up in bed and being menaced by someone with a bullwhip.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Villa!

She finally meets the guy and he takes off his mask (it was a full-head mask) and the guy has a shrunken head.  She calls him horrifying or something and it ends up with them at each other’s throats.  Then at the end of the movie, the guy’s underling (who was a demon or satanic priest or something) says that he prefers that it may have ended another way, in a more romantic manner, and the ending restarts with the shrunken-head guy taking off his mask, and then he and the woman fall in love and start making out.

733	I watched this movie on the IFC channel sometime around 2004. The film was in english, but i think the actors had Scottish accents. The film is about a shy, awkward young woman who marries a man who works on a boat. I’m not sure if he was a fisherman. He is the only person that she opens up to. She is very shy and doesn’t really speak to anyone else. The man had blonde hair, and the woman had black hair. I remember a scene where everyone is drinking and dancing at their wedding and the woman brings her new husband to the bathroom and asks him to take her virginity there. He does and then after the wedding they have a part 2 of their wedding night. I can’t really remember, but i think either her husband eventually gets into an accident at sea while working and becomes disabled or dies.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Waves	Breaking the Waves
664	I saw it a quite a few years ago on Turner Classic Movies on Silent Sunday. The theme was “Physical Handicaps Portrayed in Film” or something like that. It’s a silent film, black and white, and I think it was made in the 1910-1930’s. The story is about a young man who lives in a small forest village as a telegraph pole climber and he signs up for WWI and after the war he comes back in a wheel chair and is home bound, but he becomes the town handy man and inventor. A girl stars visiting him and he starts teaching her manners and cleans her up. She falls in love with him, but the mother disapproves because he’s in a wheel chair and she wants her to marry the rich healthy man of the village, but he’s really a bully. The paralyzed man decides he’ll talk the mother and try and convince her to let them marry. He practices all night walking on crutches but a blizzard comes in and he doesn’t make it in time. Then through sheer will power he starts walking and then running and he catches up to his love, beats up the bully, and gets the girl. If you can think of the title I’d really appreciate it.

615	I need help to find this movie based on this scenes. I’m not sure if it was a movie or tv show, but it was sure a comedy and it was in English. There was two actors (possibly federal agents or somethings like it) in some kind of silent/quiet/soundproof room/chamber to discuss something secret. Instead of voice/sound came out from their mouth, it was a bunch of color letters picture forming words (literally) and at some point they were frustated about it and tried to get rid of the words by bit/chomp them in a comical way. Please, does anyone know the title of that movie/tv show?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart,_Again!	Get Smart, Again!
749	I saw this silent movie recently at a small festival. By the looks of it, it’s an old-timey silent comedy short, a la Buster Keaton, but maybe with a more surrealist vibe. It might actually be way more recent than the Buster Keaton era. A beautiful rose grows right under a white fence separating two gardens and the two neighbors claim the right to pick it. They start fighting and wreaking havoc, completely destroying the fence. By the end, they’re both dead, and the white pickets of the fence come to life (stop-motion) and surround the two bodies, creating a small cemetery. The rose divides in two and adorns both graves.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbours_(1952_film)	Neighbours (1952 film)

So they advertise, get lots of interest and finally the film arrives.  However, they are about to open their doors when they discover that the sound track has not come with it.  They have to go on, so they make up the soundtrack whilst the film is playing. I only remember the trailer, and there’s a bit in the film where a very muscular guy is talking and being given the dialogue “And I can make my nipple go up and down like this”.

249	This movie is more modern, 2000’s and up; probably 2006 and up. Language is English I think, although may have been an accented cast. Campy, not theatre released. The film I am looking for is NOT Asian film “Noroi, The Curse.” It is American/English based. A village is abandoned and eventually floods from the new dam that is built nearby. There is some supernatural or spiritual happenings and our main characters discover witchcraft or some demonic happenings still going on underwater, despite it being flooded. I remember there are several sequences of the camera moving through the underwater town, and one of the buildings having red/orange light coming through the windows. Main characters eventually dive down and go into that building, which is where the source of the evil is.

1059	Okay this movie I would guess at late 90s early 2000 but it could be slightly earlier. It was a  english speaking comedy i think and had a scene where a guy who seemed like an odd “rich kid” adult who had a sexual interest in snakes after being locked in a room with one. I always thought it was “Ace Ventura: Nature Calls” but watched it recently and was wrong.

A few details that I can recall was that almost every time they were about to fight another group, they would be singing this song.

146	Hi! I’ve been thinkin about this movie a lot recently and I can´t seem to remember which was its name. To begin with, I watched that movie on TV here in Mexico, but for what I can remember about the aesthetic and the style of the story I know that it wasn’t a mexican movie, maybe an American or Brittish one. I can remember that it was about a girl that lived with some relatives on a farm. She was orphan and had to do the chores on the house. His relatives had a daughter that didn’t do anything and of course, the protagonist did everything for her, including knitting her a pair of socks for the winter. She was ordered to do it before the sunrise, but she was running out of time so she went and begged their rooster not to sing with the sunrise. The rooster told her that he couldn’t do anything to help her so she had to ask the sun no to rise until she was finished. At some point of the movie, the girl goes to the forest and finds a prince (I seem to remember) that gives her a chest with treasures. Her relatives get jelous and send their daughter too, but she comes back with a chest full of (I don’t remember if they were crows or pigs…something like that)… I don’t really remember much else, but I know it had a happy ending. I only saw it one time about 15 years ago and I would like to know if someone else rememebers it. THANKS!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Frost_(1964_film)	Jack Frost (1964 film)
871	What I remember about this movie that I’m trying to hunt down is that this girl was cursed or something and on her birthday she was gonna die or change or something. And her friend(s) were trying to save her and they learn more about her curse there’s a cult of rich bad people who want her to join them and in the end she does, and turns instantly bad and a little sassy towards her friends who were trying to help her.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Molly_Hartley	The Haunting of Molly Hartley

1079	I think this was a 60’s or 70’s foreign language film (possibly French or Italian) and in colour. There was a man and a woman who were either spies but more likely criminals or detectives – very glamorous. At various times in the film they would draw tattoos or pictures on each other (or it may have been just him drawing on her) The scene I remember the most is she receives a phone call while in bed. The call is from the man who is watching from down below, outside her window. Naked she moves to the window. He says something about her getting dressed. From the back you see her take the tattoo pencil and draw the straps of a dress onto her shoulders. Been bugging me for a while now so good luck…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty_Blaise_(1966_film)	Modesty Blaise (1966 film)
478	I have a feeling that it’s part of one of those movies that’s several stories on one film, but I have been trying for years to find it with no avail. Grandparents and grandchildren in living room, telling stories. Boy asks grandfather to tell an interesting one. (I think that’s how it went). Grandfather says that he has a story, but he can’t say creatures name, he writes it down. Boy says it out loud. Grandfather then has to finish story before the creature arrives. All of a sudden, you hear flapping, a roar, and two massive monster hands crash through the windows and grabs or kills grandparents. Then boy wakes up, having fallen asleep on the floor, and everyone is ok. Thanks in advance!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Darkside	Tales from the Darkside
202	I saw this movie in the early 90’s as a rental, but I think it was from the late 80’s or even the 70’s. Color, lots of yellow and brown. Story follows a young boy, living in a rural dust bowl somewhere, whose friend is murdered. I just remember bits and pieces: a menacing guy who drives around in a black car, the father is under suspicion and may be gay, the mother tries to get the boy to stop wetting the bed by making him drink glass after glass of water and stand in the kitchen for hours without peeing. And I think the father kills himself. Very sparse narrative. That’s all I can remember…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reflecting_Skin	The Reflecting Skin

657	I was born in 81 and I saw this film as a kid as a video rental. It had a modern family but they went on some sort of magical adventure. I remember several key things that would identify it. There was a focus on a mailbox or something in the mailbox that caused magical things. There was a desert with bones in it. There was a glass wall, like an invisible wall. I’ve already done a lot of web searches, it’s probably not an obvious or common movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Bandits	Time Bandits
582	Strange movie/tv show from a long time ago. I probably saw this in the late 90’s, so I was super young. All I remember was a white male with blond hair sitting on the floor in the corner of a room. There were a bunch of bobble heads or figurines of some sort surrounding him. He looks terrified, tries to get up, grabs an American flag and the bobbleheads attack. You hear him scream and see a bead of blood on one of the bobble heads. Another scene ( maybe episode?) showed the same male going up against some alley wall , kind of fusing with the wall(I know, sounds crazy) while some force caused a bunch of needles to go shooting to the wall,kind of like stabbing him, but he’s fused with the wall It’s been driving me crazy for years	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Hood	Tales from the Hood
984	Hi. I am looking for the name of this strange movie I watched years ago. (probably 2006-2010) The movie was in English, on IFC and in Color. The plot was very weird but from what I can remember it started with a Fat girl/lady who hated her life. She at one point runs away and lies on a rock. A guy in a truck stops and has sex with her. From that point she is pregnant and soon gives birth to her daughter named Candy/Candi. The movie continues to show that the lady is miserable and wants to be a icon or famous or a model. Eventually her next door neighbors or some people she knows use her for murders and crimes and make it seem like they are agents and she is doing art or “preforming”. Eventually I think Candy/Candi is killed off by her mom. The neighbor people go on trial to convict the main character of her crimes, the main character is killed off by the electric chair. I know this is rather vague but I hope this is enough information. This is all I can remember. Thanks for any help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_Trouble	Female Trouble
419	The movie was animated or CGI. A boy gets shrunk and meets the bugs. I think he gets to live in a shoe. I saw it during the early 2000’s, but it could have been made earlier. I saw it in English with subtitles in Swedish. I saw it on a TV but is almost sure it was a movie and not TV episode. It was in colour. It was a pretty scary movie as a kid. I’ve been looking around and i can’t find the movie so it isn’t very well known.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_and_the_Giant_Peach_(film)	James and the Giant Peach (film)
187	Ok so this was a weird movie I picked out when I was a kid in Blockbuster. It was on VHS and I watched it in the 90s but it could have been made in the late 80s. All I remember is it was either one or two guys kind of stoner like getting stuck in a white maze. I can’t remember if the whole movie is about them getting out of the maze. The parts I remember are there was like an Easter Bunny, a weird grandma, and a grim reaper. My description sounds like I’m getting ready to tell a joke but that’s what I remember about the movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Bogus_Journey	Bill %26 Ted%27s Bogus Journey

925	I thought I already submitted this but I don’t see it so, forgive me if it’s a duplicate. I saw a movie in July or August 2014, I believe on FOX TV network in the U.S. It was a recent movie, I’d say from the last few years but could be as old as 2000. It was in color and in English and I’m assuming it is American made. For some reason, I swear Kirsten Dunst was in this movie and keep thinking it has something to do with The Virgin Suicides but it is not that movie and I can not find it when searching Kirsten Dunst. The majority of the movie takes place in a hotel or dormitory type building where the doors are numbered. There appears to be a constant party going on in the hallway. In one room, there is some sort of support group where young people gather and I’ve young man reads from a journal if some sort. This scene reoccurs multiple times with fewer and fewer people attending I assume because they were either murdered it committed suicide. In another room, there is a young couple. The male  us in a band. The female is a blonde actress that I thought was Kirsten Dunst but was a female actress I recognized, possibly a Disney actress? They are plotting murder in that room and the girl seems to be trying to leave her family. In another room, there is a girl sitting, hugging her knees. The room is all white. Mental institution? A woman comes in and appears to try to entice her into committing suicide. The theme of the entire movie seems to be that these people are all connected in that they try to convince others to either commit murder or suicide. Another young male is in his room at home, apparently watching deaths online but he can not leave his house. A murder us committed on the streets, by one if the young males. At the end, the male who read from the journal is in the support group room and the male who was in a band comes in and murders him. I believe that us how it ended. It was a very confusing movie as I didn’t see the beginning. I keep wondering if it was a dream but my dreams do not usually follow such patterns. Any help offered will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatroom_(film)	Chatroom (film)
219	I believe this was in a movie is probably from late 70s or 80s – I remember watching it in the 90s. The part I can remember is set in America on a dusty highway. There is a female character involved. Either a supernatural being takes over control of a cool american car, like a Dodge Charger or a Trans Am. There is a ‘heads-up-display’ shown in the car when the alien/being takes over it. and I believe the car either hides in a farmyard barn at some point. I’m not sure if i’m combining movies in my head, as this has similar themes to Terminator. This has been bugging me for years! – please help! ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Car	The Car
763	Very rare movie that is scifi/dystopian/experimental/surreal. It’s like Stalker meets el Topo meets Holy Mountain meets Alphaville meets Delicatessen meets Hard to be a God, like Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Lynch had a kid together. It was color, possibly Russian, and I don’t really remember the decade but want to say 60s or 70s, though could easily be more recent. It is VERY rare, there is only one crappy partial print of it, and that is what the youtube version is from. Lot of wide shots in a surreal wilderness, winter settings, strange bleeding saturation in some shots. Crazy costumes. Seriously one of the strangest films I’ve ever seen and my favorite films are strange/weird ones. If you’ve ever seen what you’re thinking of on a “best weird movies” or “you’ve never seen this!” list, that’s NOT it. I don’t think this film even has a cult following of ten people. It’s an actual rare gem. Have been looking through selections at 366 Weird Movies and not found it yet (btw the way most of those titles are exactly the kind of not-actually-rare movies this film is definitely not).	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Silver_Globe_(film)	On the Silver Globe (film)
846	I saw a movie years ago (early 2000’s-ish?). Definitely in color, possibly in English. It was a very surreal, dream-like movie and the only scene I can remember is someone (maybe female) walking through a room with a live horse in it. As the person walks past the horse, it’s suddenly sliced vertically into several sections. The sections separate from each other, staying in place in the air. It reminded me of an anatomy book diagram showing you where the organs are in relation to the body. The horse is still alive and doesn’t seem to have noticed what’s happened to it. In one of the sections you can see it’s still-beating heart. That’s really all I can remember. To this day I’m still not certain if this was a real movie or simply a fragment of a dream I had years ago.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cell	The Cell
923	I saw this movie on TV (it’s also possible it could have been an episode of something) as a child around the early to mid-90s. It was in color and in English, but I’m not sure of its age. I didn’t get to see the whole thing, but I remember asking my mother what was going on and she responded along the lines of “this girl drew a picture and the things in it came to life”. Some vague images I remember from it were a bunch of candles (on an alter maybe) suddenly getting blown out, and what appears to be eyes and a large set of square teeth just floating in the darkness (now that I think about it, the teeth could very well have been my misinterpretation of a factory window). A little later, a girl is hiding in a closet(?) with someone else. A man who wants to harm her is searching for her amongst the backdrop of a large fire. The girl uses scissors to slowly cut a piece of paper, which I assume is the drawing. After that, I think the man finds her and tries to harm her, but they stop him. Last scene I remember is with the girl recovering in a hospital. I know its not very specific, but I’m hoping someone can help me identify what this was after all these years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperhouse_(film)	Paperhouse (film)
264	Ok , so I keep having a memory of a movie I saw as a child. I’m dying to know the title . My description is perhaps vague but here goes… Theres a girl who I believe is kidnapped by an older man.  I vividly remember scenes underground. Perhaps like subway tunnels because I remember trains passing. I believe at one point she vomits on her sweater from fear.  It was a very dark movie. Perhaps from the late 70’s / early 80’s gritty New York City era. Thanks for viewing.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Stranger_Is_Watching_(film)	A Stranger Is Watching (film)
169	I saw the movie when I was really young and sadly can recollect only one memory of it. It was 7~9 years ago so can’t be after that. Most certainly a full fledged English film. On HBO I think, or maybe some other mainstream english movie channel. The scene I remember is of a boy, maybe 8-10 years old or teen… and he was with a man who bought him some talisman of sortsrom an ordinary street vendor and there were symbols swirling inside it. The man pointed it out and said there are symbols in everything and the boy was chosen or something and only he was able to see it. I think the boy was with a girl of his same age but not very sure about that. Very vague info but this is all I can remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seeker_(film)	The Seeker (film)
375	I barely remember about that movie I watched 3-4 years ago that was on the channel ARTE I live in Switzerland (where we speak French) and I’m pretty sure it was in english there were subtitles. I guess it was an independent movie or a short film whom I just remember some passages. That was about a brunette young girl who shaved her hair when she enter a “sect” where the guru was really mean he even once pee on her when he put her in a hole as a punishment. They worked in vineyards or just yards and they had to work as a community. There was a moment when a woman (maybe her mother) tried to make her come back but I cannot be sure if I’m just confusing two different movies. I remember that at the end she just left with one of the group who followed her and they had that extra cool mini-bus like those Volkswagen one it was blue or turquoise that is the last scene of the movie. Then they just go out of the bus and laugh and walk on a long desert road. Searching on google I found that movie “Martha Marcy May Marlene” which really look alike but I know this is NOT the movie I watched.

476	This movie was about a teen who was adopted.  He starts to notice weird stuff going on around town and starts to suspect some of the town folk are monsters.  He tells his family and they don’t believe him. Some of this movie revolves around a party that was for his sister.  It was some kind of coming of age party. Turns out he was right.

204	I think I saw it around 2006 on one of the movie channels on sky, (i think it was 306). Okay so the boy and girl are teens and all that I can remember is that the boy in the film has feelings for the girl and think they’ve been friends for a long time and she’s kinda moving on and stuff and somehow she finds out he likes her as more than a friend. There’s three scenes I can remember briefly, okay so the first one, the boy imagines this other boy riding into or he imagines himself diverting the boy into a large dumpster or a skip, okay the first one either happens like that or the boy imagined himself beating up the boy into the dumpster. Okay the second scene the boy and girl are karate practice and again the boy imagines a different result, I think he might have imagined himself showing off or something. Okay this one I know for sure, the boy and girl went through like a fight and he turns up at the girls family event and they don’t say anything they just slowly dance and thats the end, the girl had blonde hair and was wearing purple I think.  I remember the title being odd like it had number in or the letter q in  I know this pretty broad and could describe a lot of films. I’ve just been trying to find this film for soo long and would appreciate any help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Manhattan	Little Manhattan
605	Though my memory on this is hazy, I think it was a low budget horror film or TV movie from the late 70’s/early 80s. It may have been a mummy movie or something to do with Egypt/curses.

I saw it on family channel (Disney channel in the U.S) and it was about this girl that everyone thought was weird and she wore hats all the time to cover her face and i think she had blue hair i don’t remember and then this girl and her guy best friend wanted to know more about her i think so they followed her around and eventually they became friends and towards the end the “weird” girl jumped off a dock into the ocean and she didn’t know how to swim so the other girl jumped in to save her and that”s really the only scene i remember from the movie does anybody know what movie that is?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Marshall_Is_Not_an_Alien	Sally Marshall Is Not an Alien
324	I saw some clips of this movie with my older sister a few years ago but I was never told the name nor did I finish it.  It’s  been on and off in my mind and lately, i can’t stop thinking about it.  It’s placed somewhere in New York, probably New Jersey judging from their accents.  In one scene, he finds out that he has a either late teen or early twenty-something year old son. I remember this one scene where his younger son is talking about his dad having sex with another woman and having a the newly discovered son.  His other late teen/early twenties daughter is doing some stripping on the side and the older son finds out about it. The dad, as mentioned before, lands an acting job and his family doesn’t believe him or something and his younger son unknowingly lies about it.  Sorry, but that’s pretty much all I can remember.    I recall it  very entertaining and quite humorous. It was an English movie and it was in color. I also don’t think it was made all that long ago.

So a few years ago, it must have been between 2009-2012 (okay so not a FEW lol) My friend left the tv on the lifetime movie channel and I didn’t really look up until halfway through but what happened was there was this woman and they made it seem like she was being followed. There was a scene where she was in the library and thought she seen the man through the bookshelves, and then I don’t remember what happened just after that but the next scene I remember is that she was in this empty house and she was being threatened by this stalker and being pushed against the wall but later in the movie it was revealed by this guy that was falling victim to her delusions, that there may not be a stalker because when he visited the house there was only 1 set of footprints in the dust. But anyways idk if he got a call or if he just traced her there but he eventually started looking for her underground or in the sewers or something with a flashlight and when it seemed like he was about to find her she bashed him over the head with a rock or something and he went down and then the camera showed the body of the so called stalker she was imagining. Any idea what this movie is guys? Please help lol I’ve been trying to find it for years.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandon_(film)	Abandon (film)
860	This was a kids sci-fi movie from the 1980s. It may have been live action. The scene I remember most was a young kid wearing futuristic clothing or a uniform and was accompanied by a furry, three-legged “pet” with a big mouth. (The creature may was a muppet, NOT computer animated.) They were in an arid region and the three-legged creature was hanging from a tree. The kid was looking to see where to go next and instructed the creature to check out ahead. The creature dropped from the tree and began running by tumbling on all three legs until it was moving like a wheel and at a very high rate of speed. Now I’m wondering if it was animated. But for some reason I remember being amazed at how they filmed the creature rolling/running with 3 legs. Let me know if this wasn’t my own imagination. Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Sapien:_People_from_Another_Star	Hyper Sapien: People from Another Star

Infact the woman and the man keeping the main character hostage are lovers and maybe brother and sister. I remember the hostage see’s them in a hot tub maybe kissing. This film may be anytime from the 90’s. I believe it to be American and I watched it over ten years ago! It was a crime themed film, sorry I cant be more help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer_Games	Reindeer Games
226	I saw this clip on dailymotion. Now they have removed it. There was a room with carpets and a few men playing instruments like congo, flute, etc. were sitting on the carpet. A topless slightly dark skinned woman was dancing on arabic steps. Two women were sitting on low chairs probably british or something. One of them gestured other one (who was wearing a hat) to join the dance. The hat woman got up and started strip dancing. Then the men stood up in “respect”. The other woman also joined the dance and started stripping. The two women stripped completely. Then the men surrounded the three women and covered them in a canopy of their “arabian” robes. The clip ended.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuelle_in_Bangkok	Emanuelle in Bangkok
432	I remember seeing this movie on TV in 1985-1986. There is this nerdy guy with glasses who is trailing this guy, who I think is a killer or at least a really bad guy. I think the nerdy guy is foreign because he does not know where things are and he meets this woman who says “What did you do? Put a pin in a map? When the bad guy finds out who the other guy is, there is a scene where he removes the guy’s glasses and then punches him in the face.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_After_Time_(1979_film)	Time After Time (1979 film)
312	I think the movie came out sometime before 2008, I’m not really sure.  I remember that the main guy is walking down a road at night after he leaves a party.  He was with his girlfriend and then he gets mad and leaves.  He sees a car, and it turns out he was murdered on his way home.  When he goes to his mother’s office and she can’t see or hear him.  He gets mad at her because he doesn’t know he’s dead.  Then he pushes all the stuff off her desk, but then he turns around and it’s all back on the desk like nothing ever happened.  He’s dead and only one girl can hear him, I think her name is Jess or something.  I’m pretty sure his body is in a lake and he needs “Jess” to find it.  She first hears him in a hallway in their school.  I really want to figure out what this movie is!  Thanks for any help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_(film)	The Invisible (film)

1021	There was this movie I saw on television about 5 years ago. It was in colour and in English. It was a late 80s or 90s movie. It was a thriller movie and I remember a scene that takes place in an underground parking lot. The scene which I remember is this- the main character is inside a parking lot and there is an SUV which is trying to kill him. The driver of the SUV is in relentless pursuit of the main character. As far as I can remember, the main character was a young man and the killer is a middle aged man and there may or may not be another injured man there. There’s no one else in the parking lot.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttle_(film)	Throttle (film)
384	i have seen this movie around a decade or two. It is colored. It is in english language. The plot is: the man (i forgot if it is a priest or a police… or neither) is investigating a cult slash village because there is something fishy about the town. The kids (might include teenagers) are missing. And it is because they are being collected by the mysterious cult. The nice thing about this movie is that the kids that are being collected should be physically beautiful (dont get me wrong what beautiful means, i just want to remember this movie). They are being collected because satan is coming back to earth beautifully. The scene i remember: the child is riding a horse in her nightgown and or with or without the man who is investigating. I think she was trying to seduce him if he was there with her on the horse. There is another scene that one of them, the child or the man is being dragged by the horse alone. Noone is on top of the horse. But it is sort of controlled by the cult using powers. Some of the kids are found but they are all kind of asleep or their faces are all cut off. The kid is the last one already for the preparation of the coming of satan here on earth to be beautiful. The dialogue i remember was: satan is coming back to earth beautiful. May not be exact. Ending: i think the cult didn’t succeed. You can say it was a happy ending for a thriller/horror movie. Or i could be wrong. Pls help me find the title. Ive been thinking about this for months already. ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eighteenth_Angel	The Eighteenth Angel
189	Ive been trying to find a movie that I saw either six or seven years ago. This is what I can remember: A girl inherits her grandfather’s house after he passes away. She moves in and plans to remodel. Theres a next door neighbour, a male, he gets involved with the girl. I think he’s a carpenter, and one night to make sure the girl is okay, they stay at his place and sleep there. I think there were wood planks and tools around. One time she goes into the kitchen, turns on the chandelier light, and sees creepy baby dolls hanging from the light. I think there were notes attached. Another time, she had just finished fixing the wall of the bathroom. Just a little bit later she finds the wall smashed (it was glass) late at night. At the end of the movie a man came into the house and her and the girl fought. The plot is probably that the man wants her grandfathers money. Now that I think about it, the male who’s protecting her might be the carpenter renovating the house, but I can’t remember. I believe I saw the movie between 2009-2011. I thought the word August was in the title, or it could be an actors name. Please help, this has been driving me insane for years ? My mom doesn’t remember watching it at all and I feel crazy like I imagined it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute_(2009_film)	Tribute (2009 film)
765	Ok. All I remember was there were a few teenagers and they were driving in the rain. Then this girl, one of the teenagers, getting chased by something. And a scene where she was in a class and her nose started bleeding and it bled so much it ran down her leg. Then the ending. She woke up and was in a wrecked car, the one from the beginning, and was the only one alive. All of her other friends were dead. It was late 90s to early 2000’s when I saw it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Survivors	Soul Survivors

243	I remember watching the trailer maybe a year ago I think the films maybe 4 years old. Everyone has like this timer on their arms which is basically how long they have to live. I think it’s the currency in the film. The rich have way more time and can live forever basically. Anyway this rich guy who says he’s lived long enough swaps his time with the main character. I can’t really remember what else happens in the trailer I think he wants to free everyone from the timer thing.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Time	In Time
381	This movie was made in the late 90s/early 80s and is about a warrior of some kind who was in a desert at the beginning of the movie, I think battling someone, then goes through a portal to the late 80s or early 90s to a big metropolitan area such as NY, Chicago, etc, and is followed by a villain that’s trying to kill him. This could have been traveling into the future or it could be a parallel universe, I can’t remember. The lead character was really muscular and was wearing body armor over his chest but also had small shorts or a loin cloth of some kind. I remember you could see a lot of muscle. He is aided by a present day girl and falls for her I believe, and I think in the end he defeats the villain and brings her back in time (or parallel universe) with him. It’s not Masters of the Universe. And I’ve looked through several time travel movie lists and haven’t found it. I used to see it on showtime or cinemax like once a week in the mid to late 90s. Usually at 5-8am on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Anyone have any ideas? It’s driving me crazy!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastmaster_2:_Through_the_Portal_of_Time	Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time
940	So it was around 2011 or 2012 and I had bought one of those 8 pack horror movie things from the dvd store and I only liked one of the movies but I can’t remember the name.  There was a girl she had dark hair I don’t remember her name, and she was just dreaming the whole movie. There was a part where she was working graveyard at the gas station and she almost got killed by some man he was trying to cut her. And she gets off and her boyfriend was gonna pick her up in a light blue truck.. And it ends up not being him it’s the same dude. Then she goes to school and she sees him again, gets upset and leaves. And there’s a part where she goes drug down into her basement by this guy and she gets her face cut off…she’s dreaming all of this tho but you never know she is dreaming until after it happened. There’s a part where that blue truck is driving with her boyfriends body in the back of the truck with the guy driving it or something. It was an older movie though like 2007.

302	I turned on the TV one night and found this gem. I don’t think I saw the beginning, but basically a single man moves into a house, hears strange noises, sees a ghost, and figures out that his place is haunted. He does some research and – a bit hazy on this part – finds that a woman was murdered there under suspicious circumstances. He has a kind of Somewhere In Time connection to this woman from the past. His attractive next door neighbor helps him solve the mystery and they dig up the dead woman’s body in his basement. After that, the woman’s ghost returns again, but this time she is in a beautiful form and makes love to him. Nevertheless, after their night of passion the gh0st still tries to kill him with a gas from the oven. The ghost keeps returning and attempting to kill the guy because the only way they can be together again is if the guy dies.  Eventually, the guy agrees to cross over to the other side by drowning in a lake with the ghost. What’s the name of this movie? I saw it probably in the mid 90’s on the Lifetime channel of some such.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forgotten_One_(film)	The Forgotten One (film)
363	I would like you to help me about a TV series which I used to watch in my teens. This is about a Journalist or Newspaper reporter who worked in this office, he was tall, fair had blue eyes and always wore glasses he used to wear leather jackets and cowboy shoes and generally he always travelled from one place to another with a motor and he also had a dog too. He had an affair sort of with one of his colleuges. She was also tall with brown eyes and hair.

751	My friend has memories of this tv show he used to watch and have copies of on vhs but he can’t remember what the show was. He says it was an English speaking show airing around the same time as first generation Power Rangers, and the plot is about a boy meeting a scientist and helping him locate strange crystals. Together with the help of a warrior girl and a troll who’s hair glows when a crystal is near they travel in their ship across various dimensions in search of these things, and with all sorts of other adventures along the way. the last episode, to the best of my friends recollection, involves the cast’s ship being damaged and then forced to combine the crystals to transport themselves to a new location where another crystal is near. There the warrior girl bites a mushroom that turns out to be a living race and gets poisoned, and the boy goes off to search for a cure. I’m at a loss myself, but has anyone else heard of this show and can provide any more information? It would be appreciated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kirby..._Time_Warrior!	Josh Kirby...

541	I wiill be very schematic. The movie is quite recent (I would say not older than 10 years but is probably a lot more recent than that).  kids A and B are playing the garden kids A asks his father (father A) if they can play with the bow father A says yeah no problem do what you want I’m on the phone (or something like that, he was quite busy and careless, wife is not home) one of the kids (kids B) ends up with an arrow in the chest or something. goes to the hospital and probably into a coma father B (father of the kid in the hospital) will blame father A for being such an irresponsible idiot father A was careless and irresponsible because he was either on the phone with his lover (cheating) or even speaking with the woman who was hiding in the house.    Something like that….pleeeeeease.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin_(film)	We Need to Talk About Kevin (film)
370	What I remember is this: There is a couple who meet up at the start of the film and it seems like they haven’t seen each other in a while. The go on a sort of holiday where they encounter a series of people and mess with them/ruin their lives. For example they convince a married couple into swinging with them, by at the last minute stop it from happening and shame them. At another point the woman pretends to be a woman with dementia’s daughter and tells her lot’s of terrible things. I think the film ends revealing that they aren’t married to each other but just meet up once a year to do this to people.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Tongues	Silver Tongues
330	Film Production Date: Unknown Film is in: Color Setting: Probably pre-Internet Actors: VERY MAYBE Sarah Michelle Gellar and Matthew Broderick, both quite young (teens) I have seen only one scene of this movie (or TV series episode?) that circulated the net as animated GIF with (yellow/white? subtitles), maybe on imgur.com or a similar site. The scene goes like this:  A young girl and a young boy (both 12-16, I’d guess), both half-dressed, seemingly a bit shy and totally clueless about sex, try to have either sex or perform a handjob on the boy. They stand in a simply furnished room with (IIRC) not much more than a bed, a chair and maybe a table.   They alternately make suggestions (more like guesses) how to go about it. When the boy makes a suggestion, he repeatedly refers to horses (“like I’ve seen horses do”, something along those lines).   One of the suggestions is that the girl should stand on a chair.   At one point, the girl tells the boy to stop making references to horses.   At one point, the girl removes her bra (no nudity is shown, thanks to the camera perspective / clipping).   At the end of the scene, the girl is seen having her hands near/in the boy’s genital area and remarking something like “oh, only so little (liquid)?”.  The girl had a “smiling dimple” that reminded me of Sarah Michelle Gellar, but I’m absolutely unsure. Even more so with Matthew Broderick. Any help appreciated!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipped_Parts	Skipped Parts
974	I believe I saw this on HBO in the late 1980s or early 1990s.  It had something to do with two teen girls–sisters maybe, where one was the “attractive and outgoing” one, the other was shy.  For some reason they had to live in a house with a woman in her 30s (or so) who was a little “off” – like in a 1930s or 40s sense (which is around when it took place) – i.e., she liked to go out, drink, etc.  I believe an old woman live there too (perhaps the 30-ish woman’s mother??)  Anyhow, I faintly remember a train track/train bridge scene where they were sitting on the bridge.  This is in English, and in color.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeping_(film)	Housekeeping (film)
989	I saw this movie on Showcase Canada late at night around 2002 or 2003. It wasn’t a new movie but they usually played European Arthouse flicks late at night. It wasn’t a TV movie, that’s for sure. The movie was in color, looked like it might have been made in the late 80s or 90s. I was changing channels a lot but I kept coming back to it, so I don’t know the whole plot. In fact, the first scene I remember of this movie was a bathroom scene where two dudes were fighting. The bathroom looked more like a locker-room shower than a traditional stall-based bathroom. As in, there were open shower faucets above and linoleum tiles below. Again, I was changing channels a lot so this scene may have been from the end of a different movie.   The next two scenes I remember are definitely from the same movie: When I came back to the movie after switching channels, it seemed like a boy and girl were kidnapped by a crazy old guy and were forced to live under his floorboards. I think there were a couple scenes where he brought the girl up from the floorboard hiding place to cook for him or something? The dude was chained below I believe. There was also a scene at the end were the two teens were running away from the old man, naked, and jumped in a pond within the forest. I believe the old man was killed by them eventually. I don’t think this was an English language film, if that helps. The forest was fairly grassy/woodlandy. Like there was a lot of green, it was probably spring/summer. The cabin where the two teens were held was very dilapitated…and the old man himself had jerky body-language. Imagine Rutger Hauer in The Hitcher, but even more skeevy in terms of appearence.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Lovers	Criminal Lovers

459	Color movie, I’m thinking mid-70s but maybe 80s. Most distinctive thing is that there was a population of evil underground dwellers or cave dwellers–not normal human beings; looked like Oompa-Loompas but with opposite colors (blues and whites, white hair), and they weren’t little people, they regular-sized adults.  They were like a mindless army; I think they were commanded by a main bad guy who was a regular human being, but evil.  The anti-Oompa-Loompas all carried a ridiculous weapon:  looked like a big wooden cooking spoon, and it must have carried some very potent poison.  They’d flick the spoon at their target (using two hands–one on the shaft of the spoon, and the other holding back the top of the spoon to offer resistance, to give the shot some “pop”), and I guess that caused poison pellets or something to fly at the victim, because any normal human who got hit by one of these shots died in seconds.  The victims were a group of men an women, I think a mix of scientists and civilians or something.  Anyone?  Anyone?!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Waits_Below	What Waits Below

451	When I was younger, I watched a terrible 80s movie that was in American English and in color.  The only things I really remember from the movie were that there was a male character with brown hair who was engaged to be married.  His bride-to-be also had brown, typical 80s curly/permed hair.  The man drove a nice car, could have been an 80s model Lamborghini, and I also recall it had a car phone.  Anyway, the man ate some sketchy food, and ended up getting feeling very sick that night.  In his feverish dreams, he had a dream that his fiancee was inside his spleen or something.  I believe she was wearing a wedding dress in his dream.  That’s pretty much all I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Takes_Two_(1988_film)	It Takes Two (1988 film)
348	For years I’ve been trying to remember something I would have seen on cable TV probably in the 80s.  I’m not sure if it was a scene from a movie or perhaps an anthology horror TV show.  From what little I remember it looked like it was set in England in the same period that a lot of Hammer horror was.  I don’t remember if there was a real vampire in the story at all or not, but I think not.  I basically just recall someone tricking a man into staking another man to death under the pretense that he was a vampire… So I think the guy kills someone, then draws some blood from the neck with a syringe.  He then drugs or knocks out some other guy and ends up dumping him in a crate in the attic, and uses the syringe to leave trickles of blood from this guy’s mouth.  Then he goes and gets another person (an older superstitious man) and takes him up to the attic and is like “look!  a vampire!” so the other guy stakes him to death. This has been a memory fragment of mine for a LONG time so I’d be very grateful for any help!  Thanks!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_of_Night	Dead of Night

There was a scene I believe where one of the friends gets taken in the back to get skinned because he has tattoos. Another friend goes to the bathroom and I think one of the stalls has no toilet ( at least I think this scene was in the show or movie).

It was in color and animated. “It was in English.  The movie was about two opposing groups in a home computer tower. They fought each other there all the time. But in the movie there is a power surge to the computer and opens a portal for the bad computer programs to escape to our world. Now for the programs to get around they would fly around on what looked like microchips. But in the human world they transformed human items into new ships.

I don’t recall if it was WW2 or the Cold War. An English man (bald, with glasses, I think), said goodbye to his family in England and  his son in boarding school. Seems like his role was that of a cartographer or translator. They went off on their mission, and I think they were successful. But as they tried to escape, they were all supposed to get on an airplane. The enemy was chasing them, and the English man was shot. At the end, one of the officers was informing the boy at his school.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Geese	The Wild Geese
505	Two guys meet with some maffia or a gang in a house. They get separated and one of them is let into a big dining hall. After they let him wait for a couple of minutes, they bring in a big trash can with a foor sticking out. He then realises its the guy he came with (his friend possibly), and he freaks out and even throws up if I’m not mistaken. Please help me remember the name of this movie! Thanks ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boys_II	Bad Boys II
446	I was around 7-9yr old and would watch it at my great grandparents house on vhs. I was young so it must’ve been somewhat age appropriate, not like an adult movie. I remember the mom and dad kept having boys and they wanted a girl. Or maybe they kept having girls and wanted a boy. They kept one girl in the attic I believe, but it was bright with some windows, and the mom drew her a bath in a claw foot tub that was in like the middle of the room. She poored water on her and I think it was hot water. I think the girl would look out the window at her siblings outside. I can’t remember much more than that. It was in English and in color. I think the girl would wear a dress. I’m beginning to think I will never figure it out.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_Under_the_Stairs	The People Under the Stairs
154	My friend saw this movie as a kid and it instilled a fear of public bathrooms for years. She says she pretended to fall asleep in the living room, fooling her parents, and saw a bit of a pretty scary movie – at least it was scary to her because she was a kid at the time. I’m guessing the year of the movie was somewhere between 1992 and 1996. From what I understand it was something of a ‘body snatchers’ type movie where some creature would kill people and masquerade around in their bodies. It was most likely set in a school. All the she can recall is scene in which a woman using a public restroom and something came from the ceiling and grabbed the woman up. The next thing you saw was her bloody high heel drop into the toilet. Any ideas?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Willies_(film)	The Willies (film)
868	Hello all, I only remember to see a couple enjoying there vacation somewhere far away on a boat in between a big lake. It is a very very silent place and provide chilling effect. Suddenly something happens in the water. Some black oily thing they say in water. They curiously keep on searching what is this black thing and how to escape it. What is in the water they keep on investigating. This seems to be a horror movie on water. No Fish, piranha or shark. Its plain horror about water and that black some thing. This black thing keeps on coming and moving spreading over the water like oil. Later i don’t remember. Please find the name of this movie Thanks in advance…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepshow_2	Creepshow 2
595	Ok. My dad had this movie when I was a kid in the 80’s.  It’s set in the future (like the 2000s)  It’s also really colorful,  live action.  There is this family that I believe lives under ground.  I remember weird food comes through hoses or pipes.  The food is either slimy or colorful and I think the family may be mutated.  I think the name is like the weird something or the freaky something.  But I haven’t seen it since the late 80’s early 90’s.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Hollowheads	Meet the Hollowheads
542	I saw this movie on HBO during the 80s. There was a girl with lots of boils on her body and she was being held in an old stone church by a weird priest. Two men and a woman rescue her by using acrobatic devices to avoid laser trip wires. They would swing along the ceiling and attach things to the wall to swing and climb on to avoid the lasers. I’m pretty sure it was in English and that I watched it on HBO as a kid. I’ve been trying to figure this out for years. Please help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_of_the_Four_Crowns	Treasure of the Four Crowns
245	In college (early to mid 90s)  I remember seeing a film on Cinemax under their Vanguard Cinema umbrella about a young boy in a small farming community whose father is accused of being a killer/serial killer.  The kid then sets out to prove his father’s innocence.  There’s one scene that stands out where he passes two nuns in the road who stare at him and make strange animal noises (clucking maybe?).  In the end the boy finds out his dad is the killer and he raises his hands in the air and screams “noooo!”  It wasn’t in English and I thought the name of the film was “Dark Dreams” or “Dark Visions” but I can find no trace of it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reflecting_Skin	The Reflecting Skin
469	I saw this movie when I was really young, like, I’m gonna say between the ages of 5-6 (2004-2005), and the movie was most likely on a VHS tape that my mother rented from the library because that’s literally all my parents did for movies when I was little. It was in color, and I wanna say Whoopi Goldberg was in it, but again, I was young, and I can’t find anything on Whoopi’s IMDb page that might be the right movie, so it probably wasn’t her. Anyways. I think the premise was there were 3 (maybe 2?) kids, one who was a young boy (maybe 7-9 in age) and he somehow communicated with this lady through a TV and somehow the kid, his older brother, and some random girl have to go to this alternate world that I’m gonna assume is somehow in the TV. The one scene I remember from this movie is a basically never-ending road with identical, white houses all up and down it. At the same time every day all of the kids would come out of the houses and start exercising. The girls were dressed in pink sweatshirts and sweatpants and jumped rope, while the boys were dressed in blue sweatpants and sweatshirts and shot basketballs through hoops. All the kids were in sync and did the exact same thing, and this black car drove up and down the road to make sure the kids were abiding by the rules (as in, doing whatever exercise they were supposed to based on gender). There was one boy who starts throwing his basketball at the garage door of his house, and he gets taken in the black car to some place that I guess was to brainwash him into abiding by the rules… And that’s all I remember.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wrinkle_in_Time_(2003_film)	A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)
805	Hello,   Can anyone recognize this film? I saw it on middle 90´s on TV and it was a very grisly film about a guy (I remember he was long haired and maybe gray hair) from the future/alien who went to Medieval Europe to investigate something; He constantly returned to his ship to talk with someone on a screen. I remember it was very grisly with some gore in it. In the end, the bad guy kills someone close to the hero, which pisses him off a lot, and run to his ship to get some futuristic gun to kill the bad guy.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_to_Be_a_God_(1989_film)	Hard to Be a God (1989 film)
585	I saw a television movie in the early 1970s about a teenage boy whose mother went for a routine checkup and died unexpectedly. But the boy, I believe his name was Harold, built himself a room behind the main living room wall and filled it with food and a bed, etc. and lived there. Other people came in, high schoolers have a party there, he watches everyone from a hole he has drilled through the wall. I don’t remember the name of this film, but it was scary.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Ronald	Bad Ronald
482	Hi, I saw a movie, probably 2 years ago, about a group of friends who end up in a small village. In this village live a few older residents who wear masks of animals during the whole movie (at least, I think it were masks), a pig’s head is one of the images that I remember clearly. The group of friends are being haunted the entire movie, trying to not get killed by the older residents most of the time. The last thing I know is that the movie ends with the original citizens betting over wich ”friend” will be able to run the longest time over a grassfield that leads them out of the city. At last, I want to apologize for the poor grammar and vocabulary of this post, I’m not really used to speak English…  Anyone know what I’m taking about? Please help me ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbred_(film)	Inbred (film)
636	I saw this movie (can’t remember if it was a TV show or movie) on TV back when I was a kid, it was a horror movie that began with a family of inbred nobles? wearing very fancy clothing who wanted to keep the family line pure. Their family ate raw meat. the family then have a son and daughter, and then they family gets kill by a mob and the children are separated while they fled. The boy gets adopted by a family then there is a timeskip. the boy has always had to eat raw meat and he wants to find out about his family so he goes back to where he came from and finds the village. the village is constantly attacked by creatures and the guy gets attacked by one and is taken to their leader who turns out to be his sister who is mom to these monsters. I do not remember anything else from the movie and want to know how the movie ends. Movie was in color, live action, but it seemed old even when i watched it in the 90s so i cant tell when it was created exactly. Thanks for any help	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeders_(film)	Bleeders (film)
947	A friend of mine described this film to me as one of the weirdest things he’s ever seen- he can’t remember a title, or a lot of the plot details, but he remembers enough that I think you guys could figure it out!   It is set in what is possibly a gas station, or diner. A man enters at some point- who is essentially set up as the “main” character (though my friend seems to recall him dying fairly early on). At some point monsters suddenly show up and start killing everyone. Later on there is also sex between the monsters, and babies pop out and begin attacking as well. He recalls a female character possibly surviving.   To note, we are certain it isn’t Legion he’s recalling in some way.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_(2005_film)	Feast (2005 film)
1004	My prof showed us a short clip in film school as an extreme example of formalism. He couldn’t stand to watch very much of it, so he only showed about 30 seconds of this movie, and I’d like to share it with my own students. It is probably from a feature film. It was in color, but a little aged. I would guess it was from the 80s. I don’t remember if the film was in English, but it looked European. It reminded me of an Eliabethan period costume drama, like Barry Lyndon, but more warm color tones. The clip was very short, so I don’t have too much to go on. It was very formalistic, almost like a montage with a lot of dissolves from scene to scene, and then back again. It took place in a palace. Everything was extremely ornate. I remember a king-like fellow walking around talking. There was one or two young boys swinging from very high swings over a gigantic indoor pool. I remember statues. I seem to remember, (or just suspect?) that one of the boys was urinating in the pool while swinging. The scene seemed to have a slightly homoerotic vibe to it. That’s all I got! I know it’s not much, but I’m sure someone here can get it! Thanks in advance!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospero%27s_Books	Prospero%27s Books
247	So we saw this movie a few years ago.  It was pretty weird , but lately I keep thinking about it. This is what I remember.  Foreign film (french?).  I think it might have been silent (or very little spoken dialogue). Mother, father, young teenage girl.  Mother is a pianist.  Wealthy family.  They move from the city to somewhere remote. There is some kind of accident or crash or drug deal gone wrong that happens near their house.  One survivor (the only one?) of the mayhem is a young teenage boy who was shot.  The girl hides him in one of the family’s outbuildngs, and tends to his serious abdominal/intestinal wounds.  Turns out the bad guys were smuggling stuff inside his body (I think drugs)– and naturally they are going to come looking for him.  The boy slowly begins to mend.  The bad guys hang around the family property and shoot the family’s dog.  The girl takes the boy to a school function or dance.  For camouflage, he is dressed as a girl.  While there, his abdominal wounds start to bleed profusely; the blood is very visible on the white dress he is wearing, and somehow… the nuns believe he has just reached puberty.  Odd, since he is bleeding from the abdomen. The boy and girl fall in love.  The bad guys are still looking for him/them.  The boy and girl leave her home for the old empty house in the city.  The bad guy(s) find them in the house.  They die together, shot, maybe in the house… but I keep picturing another location.  Empty, sad, depressing, lonely, weird and… I still don’t know what the point is. Any one out there seen this thing? THANKS!!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_(2002_film)	Moonlight (2002 film)
251	Okay so I saw a movie quite a while ago, but I don’t think it’s that old, probably came out in the past 15 years. I think it starts with a girl, she’s upset about something, so she runs a really long way to her house. I think her father is missing? From what I can remember, her room is bright white, but she draws in black ink everywhere. I think it’s fantasy/drama. Possibly a kid’s movie. I’m sorry this is so vague, I don’t think I ever finished the movie and this is all I know about it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MirrorMask	MirrorMask
334	I saw a movie within the last two years that I can not for the life of me figure out what it was. What I remember is the story is based around a women who comes to stay with a friend after a divorse or some tradegy. I can remember she drinks wine and naps and takes some sort of medicine. One day the neighbor boy comes over and he must be 16? 18? skinny longish black hair, i think he had some sort of pizza delivery job. but ends up something like he is taking pictures of her/drugs her/trys to have sex with her and she knows all of this because she has set up a camera to catch him.

693	Hello hive mind, Can anyone help me remember the name of a deeply low budget indie/arthouse/weirdo film from the ’90s that was – i think? – filmed on low res video in black and white (ie, not pixelvision but maybe one step up) and was basically about some weird kind of slug-like creature being born and maybe crawling up the side of a mountain. No dialog, just a weird kind of droning soundtrack and a lot of grainy b&w squirming. It probably had some heavy religious symbolism. I remember renting it on VHS in the mid-’90s and for some reason I associate it with the time around which I would’ve seen the first Tetsuo: Iron Man film. The title, if I recall correctly, was one word – either XXX or The XXX – and I want to say it started with the letter “I.” I could be totally making that up though. Please help.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begotten_%28film%29	Begotten %28film%29
1009	As the title states, this mid-80 to mid-90s movie has a reminiscence of both of those movies.  From what I can remember, two teens are home and something happens (magical device).  I’m not sure if they find a secret door or if a jungle/forest starts growing in their house (This jungle/forest part happens for sure as they walk through it for a scene later in the movie). They come across/save a native girl at one point.  I’m not sure if she is white or  more tanned skin to be associate with the natives and she is quite attractive from what I can remember.  I don’t think she speaks much English, broken English, or say anything at all.  I think initially she didn’t like the guys, but as the movie goes along her and the one teen start to share an attraction.  They also come across a baby dinosaur type creature, I’m not sure if he has an egg with him or something.  They are trying to protect the girl and/or the dinosaur creature from the natives in this world.  I’m not sure if they are trying to rescue the girl first or if they met up then the girl got taken away by the natives then they rescue her. The end of the movie they escape.  The one teen and the native stay together, but I’m not sure if they return back to the normal life or stay in the place they escaped from.  I’m not sure if the baby dinosaur creature stays or returns either.  Their house turns back to normal afterwards.  This movie was a more mainstream movie, I think I saw it on tv a handful of times during that era.  I’m thinking that it didn’t become real popular, but it should definitely be considered a cult classic. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0131541/ http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000530/ I’ll keep looking to try and pin point it down, but thanks for helping also.  I don’t think these are the actors (above), as I scanned through their movies (I could have missed it though, I will double check).  These two actors kind of remind me of the lead actor, I think his friend was just ever so slightly nerdy looking.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_II:_The_Second_Story	House II: The Second Story
1026	I saw a movie or show maybe about a year or two ago and there was this creepy creature with green dread lock hair that kidnapped this guy who was fishing and kept him in a cave.

977	this is a western from the 60/70’s in english and a mainstream film with regular american actors. A character climbs into the carcass of a buffalo, i’m pretty sure that he freezes to death. I vaguely remember it being a revenge movie, but not really sure. Fairly sure I saw it on telly, it was in colour and had two main protagonists, one of which died in the aforementioned buffalo.

581	Hello, this is a movie I saw on DVD between 2005 and 2009 but it’s rather old, I’d say it was made during the 1970s or 1980s   It was some kind of spaghetti western but much more violent. There was a massacre at the beginning in which a sheriff and his men purged a town by killing all the outlaws. It was pretty graphic some men were hung by the balconies I believe, other were shot (bloody)   Main characters are anti-heros fleeing this massacre. There was a beautiful woman in the group, probably a prostitute, and I think someone tries to rape her at some point of the movie.   That’s all I can recall, except maybe the title, I think it started with “The”.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_of_the_Apocalypse	Four of the Apocalypse
276	The film was in English. It was in color. It doesn’t take place in modern times. There is one scene that really sticks out to me. The heroine has a flashback to when she was younger. Some bandits are going to kill her father by hanging him. Their leader gives her the opportunity to save him by shooting the rope that’s choking him. She ends up shooting her father and killing him. The leader says something like “Close enough” and the gang rides away, leaving the girl crying in the middle of nowhere. My mom and I were watching it on the SciFi channel (before it became SyFy), and wondering what was so science fiction about it. Our question was answered when there was a scene where there’s this barn. One or two guys go into a barn and see this young woman who worked at the tavern turn around with bloody vampire teeth. I didn’t see the movie from the beginning, and I don’t think I saw the end. My parents made me leave the room whenever it got “too scary”. I’m thinking it was from summer 2007 or sometime before then.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_and_the_Dead_(1995_film)	The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)
873	I don’t remember the title of this movie but I know I have seen it when I was about 7-8 years old. I’m 16 now. Basically, I remember there were 2 siblings involved in the movie. One was a teenage girl with dark hair, and she had a little brother. I believe their home was invaded by a few boys but I don’t remember why. One boy had long black hair for sure! In one scene, I remember the teenage girl being tied to a bed as If one of the boys were about to do something bad to her! In another scene, her little brother has a secret passage in his closet that leads to his own panic room. He gets in it before any of the intruders find him. I really don’t remember much but I do know that in the end, the boy with the long hair ends up letting the siblings go and he burns the house down.

537	I don’t remember much about this movie, I watched it a long time ago on the TV. It was in English, in colour and I think it was some kind of period fantasy film. So, there was this blonde guy, who could sketch really well, and he was travelling with a friend of his (I think his friend was exotic, but I’m not really sure about that) and they were looking for a beast. I can remember a scene where this blonde guy was in a brothel and he drew this woman, who predicted something about his future (she had a black knife and I think she might have been a witch or something?).. Later he met with some aristocrats and fell in love with a girl there…. so they were kind of constantly flirting and going back and forth throughout the movie. Eventually this guy was part of a hunting party with the girl and other aristocrats…and I think his friend died. That’s pretty much all I can remember and I really hope this movie actually exists.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Wolf	Brotherhood of the Wolf

He worked in a butcher shop, and when he would kill people he would store them in a meat locker. I don’t think he spoke much either in the movie.

The demon possessed man then kills him and makes her cook and eat him or he threatens to kill the children too.

878	The movie in question scared me enough from the one scene that I DID see that I didn’t watch the rest of the movie.  I was around 10 or so at the time and now 25 years later I’d like to know what the hell the movie was about. In the one scene I can remember, I want to say ‘a group of teenagers’ some how find a very ornate ‘music box’ looking device which had either a ‘key’ or ‘medallion’ to turn it on or wind it.  One of the teens held it in the palm of his(?) hand and activated it. All stood around and watched (like idiots) as the device ‘opened’ and extended spider-like legs which clasped around the holder’s hand and latched into place, making it then impossible for him to just drop it. Once those legs were secured around his hand, one last scorpion-tail-like appendage folded out of the device and plunged rather firmly into the holder’s wrist. I have no idea what effect it had, as I was already hiding from the TV by then.  The few facts I can include here I remember vividly after 25 years .. I don’t remember anything else.  the approximate date you saw it,  around the age of 10, so around 1988 to 1993 ~ish   whether it was in English or another language,  I would say it was in English but I don’t remember any dialog   whether you saw it on TV (it might be a TV episode rather than a movie),  I saw it at home on -a- TV.  I -think- it was a movie, but I guess it -could- have been a TV show.   whether it was in color or black and white, and  I am fairly certain it was in color   anything else you can think of that might help pinpoint the film.  I was afraid of the one scene I did see, so I do not think I ever watched any of the rest.    Thanks for reading my post and trying to help!

All I remember is a woman climbing out of bed and getting in the shower and the shower fills up and she can’t get out. I think another part was she had a flashback or maybe it was a different scene, but there’s a woman in the middle of a crowd who sees a man she knows and is trying to get his attention but he seems to be ignoring her. Same movie. I remember my parents saying something about “dream” and/or “child” but I couldn’t find anything when I googled it.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_5:_The_Dream_Child	A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child
281	I re-call a scene in a film where there is a desolate road with a Badger sniffing around the tarmac and a car speeds toward it on a curve.  The car runs over the badger and comes to a halt. A woman gets out and stares into the horizon, where there is a city or town with smoke plumes and the sound of gunfire and explosions akin to military weapons.  She shows no concern for the dead badger, staring vacantly into the distance. It was in colour, maybe european. Anyone know the film`s name?  	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Moon_(1975_film)	Black Moon (1975 film)
964	I saw a movie some years ago, the film itself was older, probably early 70’s. It was in color, and english, I think it was set in New York , or a city. I don’t remember the plot very much, just mainly that it was about a woman. I mostly recall the beginning because it really caught me off guard. A woman (I believe the one the movie is about) was giving birth, and they actually showed the baby coming out. It wasn’t fake at all, I’m pretty sure it was an actual birth. They cut it together with the actresses face and it looked like she was really giving birth. Maybe that’s too progressive for the 70’s? I’m not sure…I saw the film in the early 2000’s at some point, so maybe it was never an just looked old? I’m not sure…hoping someone knows what I’m talking about.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Cow	Poor Cow
1078	I saw this movie in the early 90s but I think it is an 80’s romantic movie. I saw it on TV and can’t tell if it was a B-movie or not. I believe it was based in New York and during the 80’s. There was a young woman who just moved in, in an appartment (studio like) that was offered to her by a friend. But the first day, a man also moves in (the friend seems to offered the appartment to both of them by mistake). At first they hate each other, then they fall in love. There is a scene where she climps down the stairs to find him sleeping but actually he is asleep and it is the nigh they make love. I think he was something like a chef.  Meanwhile he gets famous because he has a cooking tv-show. They break up because she thinks she cheats on her, finding his car (red I think) parked outside the house of his beautiful co-show host. I remember a scene where she picks up a frozen meal from a store refrigarator and cries because she sees his face on it. The last thing I remember is that he proposes to her with a ring hidden in a glass of champagne. The movie also had a nice romantic song when the credits appear, something we rain or raindrops in the lyrics.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_Love_(film_series)	Shades of Love (film series)
137	I saw this B grade midday movie about 20 years ago. Im guessing its late 80s, early 90s. In my minds eye, the actress kinda reminds me of Ashley Judd but dont let this distract you from the plot below; like when you say “his name starts with M”, “Johnny?”, “yeah Johnny, I told it started with M” ? So the bit I think I remember – the man walks in, maybe a hotel room, and finds the woman has tied a guy up with masking tape on the couch. She proceeds to kill this guy by spraying an aerosol can in his mouth. They fight/struggle and end up having rough sex. The woman has left the phone off the hook on purpose and makes it sound like the man killed the guy and did rape her. The movie is the man, in jail, telling to his lawyer what happened (this may only have been revealed at the end, the rest plays out like its live) and of course the lawyer doesnt believe him. The man is then taken away into custody and the movie finishes. I think the man was dating the woman who just moved into town and started working with him? Be aware, if you get this, Ive got a real hard one next ?	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Seduction	The Last Seduction
428	In this movie this woman works in some high security building. There is a buff security guard that is obsessed with her. The security guard has cameras everywhere. The security guard gets upset when he sees the woman making out with her boyfriend in the parking lot. The security guard then traps the woman and her boyfriend in the building. Most of the movie is just cat and mouse with them trying to escape. She finally is able to break the glass but he threatens to kill her boyfriend. Does this sound familiar?  I want to say that I saw it on TV in the late 90’s.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Level	Lower Level

489	I saw this movie in about 2000 year. It was comedy movie. A woman who wore red coat and shoes moved in an apartment for rent. A old man won lottery who lives in it. But his neighbours intend to get his money and wait to die him. So the old man can’t go out even his room. The new neighbour woman knows in the first  that the old man died. Then  she can get his money and run away from others but they know her and race her. The woman plots with one of them and can run away together from them. After they have lottery money, They meet in a cafeteria and decide to married. I want to watch it again but i don’t remember the name of the movie.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_comunidad_(film)	La comunidad (film)
267	I saw this movie as a child, which was in the late 90’s/early 2000’s but it could have been older (most likely). It was on tv, but a movie. All I remember is a teenage girl being tormented (not brutally) by a witch or spirit in a house, and she runs into the bathroom where she hallucinates and sees worms coming out of the bathroom sink, and I think eventually from everywhere else. It was in color, no older than late 80’s made, in English. Sorry, thank you and good luck!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Craft_(film)	The Craft (film)
1094	This movie is in color, English, USA made. It is likely from 5-10 years ago. Maybe a comedy or romcom. The scene I remember: A young woman shows up to a party to which she had been invited. Someone is with her–a date or a friend. The party-goers enter through the front door. The party is in an expensive modern house, or maybe a large apartment. It’s a dancing type of party. Like a fancy nightclub. The woman has brought something with her–maybe cookies on a plate covered in tinfoil or a casserole in a glass pan. She brought the food because her mother told her never to show up to a party empty-handed. (I don’t know when this was talked about–maybe it was repeated during the movie.) The party hostess is a bit surprised/confused, but very polite and takes the dish and welcomes the friends. The woman arriving at the party might be Anne Hathaway, but I haven’t tracked down the movie/scene yet, so I could be wrong–maybe way off on that. Thank you for anyone who can help!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_Lyrics	Music and Lyrics
900	I saw this movie on TV in the last 60s or early 70s, it was in color I think. A man on the run from the law ends up hiding out in a small (Italian? French?) town, pretending to be a famous movie director.  He picks up a professional actor and actress, and much of the movie consists of him pretending to direct them in scenes, without revealing that he knows nothing of film. In one scene, he films them sitting at a cafe table.  When they ask what their lines are, has says that they have no lines – that the scene is about the modern people’s inability to communicate.  So there is 5 minutes of then looking awkward. In another scene, he says he wants to film them running through the streets of the town.  When asked what their motivations are, he replies, “You are running…. from yourselves!” I remember this movie being very funny, and making fun of “method acting” and pretentious film critics. Any help appreciated, this has been bugging me for years ? !	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Fox	After the Fox
614	I think it’s a movie from the 80’s but could also have been from a tv show.  A couple of little girls (or possibly a family) are refugees from vietnam (or possibly elsewhere).  An american couple is helping them. A little girl drops a ring down a bathroom sink and freaks out and cries because it’s from her home/family.  The man helper takes apart the pipes and finds the ring.  I have been searching for this for years.  Any ideas would be much appreciated!	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series	Walt Disney anthology television series
1016	I remember watching this when I was quite young so probably came out in the early 90’s but not too sure. The only scene I remember is A man retelling a scene from his youth when his mother, younger sister and himself are raped by a gang of robbers.. it was quite intense…. The father later comes home from work and they all pretend it didn’t happen… i think the scene ends with them all siting around the table and the man says the only thing that would of given it away was the fact that the little girls dress was inside out from when her mother hurriedly got her re-dressed.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince_of_Tides	The Prince of Tides
875	I saw the movie somewhere around 1986-88? on TV about young (high school) musician boy who played electronic music on a keyboard. Once he got injured in a car accident (or trapped in the car and hit with a fork lift) and lost both hands. With a help of his friends he got mechanical hands which could be programmed to type some sequence. With this and some practice he was able go back on scene and play on the concerts. He also had a mask, so he looked like a robot. I remember there was lots of nice electronic music, but what was the title of the movie? I cannot recall…	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrations_(film)	Vibrations (film)
1010	I know that this description sounds a lot like “Motel Hell,” but I am positive it is not. I saw this black-and-white movie in the mid-70s, but it was an old movie even then. A young woman goes to stay at a farm or a resort (to gain weight or lose weight, maybe?), and realizes that the caretakers are butchering people for meat. Somehow, she defeats them, and the final scene is of the freezer or meat locker, where we see the heads of the two dead caretakers. At the very last second, one of the heads winks at us.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_at_Red_Wolf_Inn	Terror at Red Wolf Inn
580	I remember this monster or zombie movie where a monster or zombie is going around biting and killing people and I remember the thing saw a group of cheerleaders training and it bit one of them on her bottom and she was running and screaming as well as the others but thats all i remember. I think its a popular movie	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Living_Dead:_Rave_to_the_Grave	Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave

109	This is an old movie. As far as I remember, the plot was the following: Some guys stole/found a truck from a military convoy that turns out it had an alien inside. The alien was done by a guy in a bright green suit, kind of silly looking. They decided to kill the alien, by cutting him in parts and burning them in the crematorium. I think, when they cut his hand and other limbs they noticed they remained moving, so it couldn’t be killed. They burnt the body. After which, the smoke from the fire went in the atmosphere, turned into a cloud and rained down over the cemetery. Which of course lead to infecting the dead bodies and they becoming zombies. I think the movie ended as the government nuked the town. Saw this movie a few years back, it looked like 50s – 60s movie. It was in color. I watched it on the MGM channel, so I suspect it is MGM movie. The movie was in English language.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Living_Dead	The Return of the Living Dead
